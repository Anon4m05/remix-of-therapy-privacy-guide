     Obviously, however, therapeutic jurisprudence will also have appli-                            jurisprudence beyond simply law professors –by including mental

    As it was clear to David that the boundaries of therapeutic juris-

me. Thus, in early 1993, abetted substantially by David's urging, I

    The core of the philosophy of therapeutic jurisprudence was being                               arguing that TJ “has sought to look at the law in a richer way by ponder-

whether legal rules, procedures, and lawyer roles can or should be                                  (legal rules and legal procedures) and of the `practices and techniques'

    Therapeutic jurisprudence, Wexler has emphasized, forces us to look                                 At this point, Wexler has proposed the adoption of “TJ-friendly legal

therapeutic jurisprudence had to explore “insights from other ﬁelds–                                and intimate relationship between the wine and the bottles— between

other disciplines for nourishment and growth.”58                                                    that TJ has gone beyond the typical boundaries of procedural justice,
