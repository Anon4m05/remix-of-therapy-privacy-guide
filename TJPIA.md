# Therapeutic Jurisprudence-Centered Privacy Impact Assessment

## Knowledge File for LLM Design Assistance



---



## 1. FOUNDATIONAL CONTEXT



### 1.1 The Theoretical Gap This Assessment Addresses



**Current State of Privacy in Bioethics:**

Privacy is discussed in bioethics but fragmented across three inadequate framings:

1. **Derivative of Autonomy** - Privacy treated as subset of autonomous decision-making, not a distinct principle

2. **Reduced to Confidentiality** - Privacy understood as negative right to secrecy, not positive agency/control over narrative

3. **Relegated to Compliance** - Privacy framed as legal obligation (PHIPA requirements), not therapeutic dimension of care



**The Problem with Separation:**

- **Law** is analyzed as compliance: "What MUST we do under privacy legislation?"

- **Ethics** is analyzed as values: "What SHOULD we do to respect persons?"

- **No framework asks:** "How do privacy practices, shaped by law, produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects?"



**Why Traditional PIAs Are Insufficient:**

Standard Privacy Impact Assessments focus on:

- Legal compliance (meeting PHIPA/FIPPA requirements)

- Risk mitigation (preventing breaches, unauthorized access)

- Information flow mapping (who has access to what)

- Technical safeguards (encryption, access controls)



**What they MISS:**

- How privacy practices affect therapeutic relationships

- Whether privacy practices enhance or diminish trust

- How information governance impacts patient agency

- Whether privacy enables or inhibits care delivery

- Psychological/emotional consequences of privacy decisions

## 2. THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE FRAMEWORK



### 2.1 Core Principles of Therapeutic Jurisprudence



**Definition:**

> "The study of the role of the law as a therapeutic agent. Legal rules, legal procedures, and legal actors constitute social forces that, whether intended or not, often produce therapeutic or antitherapeutic consequences." (Winick, 1991)



**Key Insight for Privacy:**

Privacy laws and practices are not neutral—they are **interventions** that can heal or harm therapeutic relationships.



### 2.2 Applying TJ to Privacy: The Paradigm Shift



**From Compliance → To Clinical Variable**



| Traditional Privacy Framing | TJ-Centered Privacy Framing |

|------------------------------|------------------------------|

| Privacy is legal obligation | Privacy is clinical variable affecting outcomes |

| Focus: Risk mitigation | Focus: Therapeutic impact |

| Question: "Are we compliant?" | Question: "Does this promote therapeutic relationships?" |

| Privacy protects information | Privacy enables trust, agency, safety |

| Binary: Share or don't share | Contextual: How to share therapeutically |

| Clinician sees privacy as barrier | Clinician sees privacy as enabler of care |



**The Therapeutic Dimensions of Privacy:**



1. **Trust Formation**

   - Patients trust clinicians who respect privacy boundaries

   - Trust enables disclosure of sensitive information critical for diagnosis/treatment

   - Privacy breaches (or perceived breaches) erode therapeutic alliance



2. **Patient Agency & Control**

   - Privacy practices determine whether patients have meaningful control over their narrative

   - Agency ≠ blanket secrecy; agency = meaningful participation in information governance

   - Lack of control → disempowerment, withdrawal, non-engagement



3. **Psychological Safety**

   - Privacy practices create conditions for emotional vulnerability necessary in therapeutic contexts

   - Fear of unwanted disclosure → withholding information → diagnostic/treatment gaps

   - Safe disclosure environment → therapeutic progress



4. **Relational Boundaries**

   - Privacy defines "circle of care" boundaries that enable coordinated care while respecting patient control

   - Clear boundaries → role clarity → reduced ethical distress for clinicians

   - Boundary violations → confusion, role strain, fractured therapeutic relationships



5. **Dignity & Respect**

   - Privacy practices signal respect for persons

   - Bureaucratic, rigid privacy processes → dehumanization

   - Thoughtful, contextual privacy practices → recognition of personhood

## 3. DESIGNING A TJ-CENTERED PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT



### 3.1 Assessment Architecture



**Dual-Track Evaluation:**

A TJ-centered PIA must assess BOTH:

- **Track 1: Compliance** (standard PIA elements - legal requirements, risk mitigation)

- **Track 2: Therapeutic Impact** (new TJ-centered elements - how practices affect relationships/outcomes)



**Critical Principle:**

Compliance is **necessary but insufficient**. A practice can be fully compliant with privacy law yet produce anti-therapeutic effects. Conversely, some therapeutic practices may require creative interpretation of legal frameworks.



### 3.2 Core Assessment Questions



#### **CATEGORY 1: Therapeutic Impact on Patients**



**1.1 Trust & Disclosure**

- How will this privacy practice affect patients' trust in the care team?

- Will patients feel safe disclosing sensitive information necessary for care?

- Does this practice signal respect or create barriers to open communication?

- What is the risk that patients will withhold clinically relevant information due to privacy concerns?



**1.2 Agency & Control**

- Do patients have meaningful control over how their information is used?

- Are consent processes genuinely informed and voluntary, or bureaucratic rituals?

- Can patients exercise control without negative consequences (e.g., denial of care)?

- Does this practice enable patient participation in information governance decisions?



**1.3 Psychological Safety**

- Will patients experience this privacy practice as protective or intrusive?

- Does this practice create conditions for emotional vulnerability necessary in therapy/care?

- What psychological harm might result from this information sharing approach?

- Are safeguards in place to prevent re-traumatization through privacy processes?



**1.4 Dignity & Personhood**

- Does this practice treat patients as persons with unique contexts and needs?

- Are privacy practices flexible enough to honor individual patient values?

- Does this practice inadvertently objectify or dehumanize patients?



#### **CATEGORY 2: Therapeutic Impact on Clinicians**



**2.1 Clinical Effectiveness**

- Does this privacy practice enable or inhibit clinicians' ability to deliver care?

- Can clinicians access information needed for diagnosis/treatment in timely manner?

- Does this practice support coordinated care across the care team?

- What workarounds might clinicians develop if privacy practices are too restrictive?



**2.2 Ethical Decision-Making**

- Does this privacy framework provide clarity for ethically complex situations?

- Are clinicians equipped to navigate competing interests (patient privacy vs. safety, family involvement, etc.)?

- Does this practice reduce or increase moral distress for clinicians?

- Are there decision support tools for navigating privacy dilemmas?



**2.3 Therapeutic Relationship**

- Does this privacy practice support or undermine the clinician-patient relationship?

- Can clinicians honor patient privacy preferences without compromising care?

- Does this practice enable authentic, trust-based therapeutic relationships?



#### **CATEGORY 3: Therapeutic Impact on Systems/Organizations**



**3.1 Institutional Culture**

- Does this privacy practice promote culture of trust or culture of surveillance?

- Are privacy protections equitably applied across all patient populations?

- Does this practice enable or inhibit organizational learning from adverse events?

- Is privacy weaponized to obscure accountability ("weight of silence")?



**3.2 Resource Allocation**

- Are resources invested in therapeutic privacy practices or merely compliance?

- Do privacy investments strengthen or weaken care delivery capacity?

- Are privacy safeguards accessible to frontline staff in real-time?



**3.3 Systemic Equity**

- Do privacy practices differentially impact marginalized or vulnerable populations?

- Are culturally specific privacy needs recognized and accommodated?

- Does information governance perpetuate or challenge existing power imbalances?



### 3.3 Assessment Methodology



**Step 1: Map Information Flows (Standard PIA)**

- What personal health information is collected?

- Who has access? Under what circumstances?

- How is information stored, transmitted, disclosed?

- What technical/administrative safeguards exist?



**Step 2: Identify Stakeholders & Relationships**

- Who are all parties affected by this privacy practice?

- What therapeutic relationships are implicated?

- Map competing interests and potential conflicts



**Step 3: Evaluate Therapeutic Effects**

For each stakeholder/relationship, assess:

- **Therapeutic Effects** (practices that enhance trust, agency, safety, dignity, care delivery)

- **Anti-Therapeutic Effects** (practices that erode trust, disempower, create fear, dehumanize, inhibit care)

- **Neutral Effects** (practices with minimal therapeutic impact)



**Step 4: Analyze Mechanisms**

- **How** does this practice produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects?

- What are the causal pathways (e.g., restrictive consent process → patient feels powerless → withholds information → diagnostic gap)

- Are effects intended or unintended?



**Step 5: Identify Alternatives**

- Are there alternative approaches that maintain compliance while enhancing therapeutic outcomes?

- Can anti-therapeutic effects be mitigated through design changes?

- What trade-offs exist between different therapeutic goals?



**Step 6: Make Recommendations**

- Prioritize changes based on therapeutic impact potential

- Propose redesigns that intentionally leverage privacy for therapeutic benefit

- Identify areas requiring policy/procedure changes vs. cultural shifts



### 3.4 Scoring/Evaluation Framework



**Therapeutic Impact Score (for each assessed practice):**



| Score | Therapeutic Impact | Description |

|-------|-------------------|-------------|

| +2 | Strongly Therapeutic | Measurably enhances therapeutic relationships, trust, agency, or care outcomes |

| +1 | Therapeutic | Positive impact on therapeutic dimensions, supports relationship-building |

| 0 | Neutral | Minimal therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effect |

| -1 | Anti-Therapeutic | Undermines trust, agency, or care delivery; creates barriers |

| -2 | Strongly Anti-Therapeutic | Significant harm to therapeutic relationships; major barriers to care |



**Dimensions to Score:**

- Impact on patient trust

- Impact on patient agency

- Impact on psychological safety

- Impact on clinician-patient relationship

- Impact on care coordination

- Impact on ethical decision-making

- Impact on institutional culture



**Overall Assessment:**

- **Exemplary** (Avg +1.5 to +2): Privacy practices intentionally designed for therapeutic benefit

- **Therapeutic** (Avg +0.5 to +1.5): Generally supportive of therapeutic relationships

- **Mixed** (Avg -0.5 to +0.5): Some therapeutic benefits, some anti-therapeutic effects

- **Anti-Therapeutic** (Avg -1.5 to -0.5): Practices undermine therapeutic relationships

- **Harmful** (Avg -2 to -1.5): Significant barriers to care and relationship-building

## 4. KEY DISTINCTIONS FROM TRADITIONAL PIAs



### 4.1 What Makes This Assessment Different



| Traditional PIA | TJ-Centered PIA |

|-----------------|-----------------|

| **Primary Focus:** Legal compliance | **Primary Focus:** Therapeutic outcomes (with compliance as baseline) |

| **Risk Framing:** Information breach, unauthorized access | **Risk Framing:** Erosion of trust, patient disengagement, care gaps |

| **Success Metric:** No privacy violations | **Success Metric:** Enhanced therapeutic relationships, improved care |

| **Stakeholder View:** Data subjects, data custodians | **Stakeholder View:** Patients, families, clinicians, care teams, institutions |

| **Information Model:** Asset to be protected | **Information Model:** Relational tool enabling trust and care |

| **Design Orientation:** Risk mitigation | **Design Orientation:** Therapeutic enhancement |

| **Question:** "Is this legal?" | **Question:** "Does this help or harm?" |



### 4.2 Integration, Not Replacement



**Critical Note:**

A TJ-centered PIA does NOT replace traditional privacy impact assessment—it **augments** it.



- Traditional PIA ensures legal compliance, identifies security risks, maps information flows

- TJ-centered PIA adds therapeutic lens: "Given we're compliant, are we therapeutic?"



**Both are necessary.** A practice can be:

- Compliant but anti-therapeutic (rigid consent processes)

- Therapeutic but non-compliant (inappropriate information sharing)

- **Ideal: Compliant AND therapeutic** (thoughtfully designed practices)



---



## 5. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE



### 5.1 Assessment Process



**Phase 1: Scoping (Traditional + TJ)**

- Define what privacy practice/system is being assessed

- Identify all affected stakeholders and therapeutic relationships

- Determine assessment scope (single practice vs. systemic evaluation)



**Phase 2: Information Gathering**

- **Standard PIA data:** Information flows, technical architecture, legal requirements

- **TJ-specific data:** 

  - Stakeholder interviews (patients, clinicians, administrators)

  - Observational data (how privacy practices function in real clinical contexts)

  - Incident analysis (privacy breaches AND therapeutic harm incidents)

  - Policy/procedure review (formal requirements vs. actual practice)



**Phase 3: Therapeutic Impact Analysis**

- Evaluate each practice against TJ assessment questions (Section 3.2)

- Score therapeutic impact across dimensions (Section 3.4)

- Map causal mechanisms (how practices produce effects)

- Identify patterns (systemic issues vs. isolated concerns)



**Phase 4: Recommendations**

- **Immediate fixes:** High anti-therapeutic impact, easy to change

- **Policy revisions:** Require formal approval but significant therapeutic benefit

- **Cultural shifts:** Long-term investments in changing privacy culture

- **Innovative approaches:** Creative redesigns leveraging privacy therapeutically



**Phase 5: Monitoring & Iteration**

- Establish metrics for tracking therapeutic impact over time

- Implement feedback mechanisms (patients, clinicians, administrators)

- Reassess periodically as practices evolve



### 5.2 Sample Assessment Questions (Practical Tool Format)



**For Each Privacy Practice, Ask:**



**Trust Impact:**

- [ ] Would patients feel safer or more vulnerable because of this practice?

- [ ] Does this practice signal that we value patient confidences?

- [ ] Could this practice inadvertently breach patient trust?



**Agency Impact:**

- [ ] Do patients have meaningful say in how this information is used?

- [ ] Is consent genuine or bureaucratic ritual?

- [ ] Can patients change their mind without negative consequences?



**Care Delivery Impact:**

- [ ] Can clinicians access information they need to provide safe, effective care?

- [ ] Does this practice support or hinder care coordination?

- [ ] What workarounds might clinicians develop if practice is too restrictive?



**Psychological Safety Impact:**

- [ ] Will patients feel safe being vulnerable/disclosing sensitive information?

- [ ] Could this practice trigger trauma or psychological harm?

- [ ] Does this practice create protective environment for difficult conversations?



**Relationship Impact:**

- [ ] Does this practice strengthen or weaken clinician-patient relationships?

- [ ] Can clinicians honor this practice authentically without compromising care?

- [ ] Does this practice enable or inhibit therapeutic rapport?



**Equity Impact:**

- [ ] Are privacy practices applied equitably across all patient populations?

- [ ] Do privacy practices accommodate cultural/contextual privacy needs?

- [ ] Could this practice disproportionately harm marginalized groups?

## 6. DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR TJ-CENTERED PRIVACY PRACTICES



When designing privacy practices assessed through TJ lens, prioritize:



### 6.1 Contextual Flexibility

- **Principle:** Privacy practices should be adaptable to individual patient contexts, not rigid one-size-fits-all rules

- **Example:** Consent processes that allow patients to specify who in their circle of care has access to what information, not blanket all-or-nothing consent



### 6.2 Transparent Communication

- **Principle:** Privacy practices should be clearly explained in plain language, not buried in legal jargon

- **Example:** Clinicians explain why they're asking for consent and how information will be used, not just handing patients a form to sign



### 6.3 Patient-Centered Control

- **Principle:** Patients should have meaningful agency over information governance, not symbolic participation

- **Example:** Patients can request that certain information not be shared with specific family members, and system honors this



### 6.4 Relationship-Based Boundaries

- **Principle:** Privacy boundaries should support therapeutic relationships, not create barriers between patients and care teams

- **Example:** Circle of care definitions that enable coordinated care while respecting patient preferences



### 6.5 Therapeutic Accountability

- **Principle:** When privacy is breached or practices fail, response should be therapeutic (transparency, repair) not punitive (cover-up, blame)

- **Example:** Open disclosure of privacy breaches with focus on patient support and systemic learning



### 6.6 Dignity-Preserving Processes

- **Principle:** Privacy practices should treat patients as whole persons with unique needs, not data subjects

- **Example:** Privacy assessments conducted through compassionate conversations, not bureaucratic interrogations

## 7. COMMON ANTI-THERAPEUTIC PRIVACY PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY



### 7.1 "Privacy as Weapon"

- Using privacy to obscure accountability (refusing to disclose adverse event details citing "staff privacy")

- Administrators invoke privacy to shut down patient questions

- **Assessment flag:** Privacy used strategically to avoid transparency



### 7.2 "Bureaucratic Rituals"

- Consent forms administered as box-checking exercise

- Patients sign without understanding what they're consenting to

- No genuine opportunity for questions or negotiation

- **Assessment flag:** Compliance without comprehension or agency



### 7.3 "Information Silos"

- Overly restrictive information sharing within circle of care

- Clinicians lack access to information needed for safe care

- Patients forced to repeat history multiple times

- **Assessment flag:** Privacy undermining care coordination



### 7.4 "Paternalistic Withholding"

- Clinicians decide what patients "need to know" vs. have right to know

- Information withheld "for patient's own good"

- Family given information patient isn't given

- **Assessment flag:** Privacy used to control rather than empower



### 7.5 "Cultural Insensitivity"

- Privacy practices ignore cultural contexts where family involvement expected

- One-size-fits-all approach to consent

- No accommodation for collectivist vs. individualist privacy norms

- **Assessment flag:** Privacy practices as cultural imposition



### 7.6 "Technological Barriers"

- Electronic health record systems create information access obstacles

- Clinicians spend more time navigating privacy restrictions than providing care

- Technology prioritizes data security over clinical usability

- **Assessment flag:** Privacy infrastructure inhibiting care delivery

- ✅ Anti-therapeutic effects mitigated through policy/procedure changes

- ✅ Clinicians equipped with frameworks for therapeutic privacy decision-making

- ✅ Patients report increased trust, agency, and psychological safety



### 8.3 Cultural Shifts

- ✅ Privacy seen as enabler of care, not just compliance requirement

- ✅ Therapeutic impact routinely considered in privacy decisions

- ✅ Open discussion of tensions between privacy and care (not swept under rug)

- ✅ Organizational learning from privacy incidents focused on systemic improvement

## 9. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION RECAP



**Bioethics → Therapeutic Jurisprudence → Privacy → Privacy as Ethical Principle**



**The Logic:**



1. **Bioethics** recognizes four foundational principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) but treats privacy as derivative or compliance concern



2. **Therapeutic Jurisprudence** provides lens for examining how legal rules/practices produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects



3. **Privacy**, examined through TJ lens, reveals itself as **clinical variable** affecting therapeutic outcomes—not just legal constraint



4. **Privacy as Ethical Principle** emerges: Privacy doesn't just serve the other four principles—it **enables** them. Privacy:

   - **Enables autonomy** (agency to control narrative)

   - **Supports beneficence** (trust that enables disclosure critical for care)

   - **Prevents harm** (psychological safety, dignity preservation)

   - **Promotes justice** (equitable information governance)



**Therefore:**

Privacy deserves recognition as **fifth foundational principle in bioethics**, not relegated to compliance or subsumed under autonomy. A TJ-centered PIA operationalizes this recognition by assessing how privacy practices function therapeutically in clinical contexts.
