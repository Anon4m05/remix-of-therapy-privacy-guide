    "summary": "This decision addresses a privacy breach reported under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, by Windsor Regional Hospital (WRH), Chatham-Kent Health Alliance and Eries Shores HealthCare (collectively, the Hospitals). The Hospitals reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario that a physician with privileges at WRH used his access to the Hospitals\u2019 shared electronic health record system to conduct targeted searches for newborn males and then contacted the parents to offer them circumcision services through his private pediatric clinic, WE Kidz Pediatrics (WE Kidz).\nIn this decision, the Commissioner considers whether WRH and WE Kidz took reasonable steps to protect against unauthorized collection, use and disclosure of personal health information within their custody or control; whether WRH and WE Kidz had information practices in place and whether they complied with those information practices; whether WRH and WE Kidz responded adequately to the breach; and, whether administrative monetary penalties should be imposed against the physician and/or WE Kidz.\nIn this decision, the Commissioner makes no order against the Hospitals but makes a number of recommendations to WRH to improve its record-keeping and information practices to ensure that WRH can more effectively demonstrate compliance with its obligations under PHIPA.\nThe Commissioner determines that AMPs are appropriate in the circumstances and orders an AMP of $5,000 to be imposed against the physician and an AMP of $7,500 against WE Kidz for contraventions under PHIPA. She also orders that the physician and WE Kidz securely dispose of all records containing personal health information inappropriately obtained from the shared EHR system and used by the physician to offer circumcision services at WE Kidz.\nFinally, the Commissioner recommends that WE Kidz strengthen its privacy policies and procedures to ensure that it meets its obligations under PHIPA and that WE Kidz management and staff undergo further privacy training.",

    "therapeuticAnalysis": "**TJ Analysis — Abuse of Legitimate Access & Informational Asymmetry:**\nThis decision exemplifies the 'Privacy as Weapon' anti-therapeutic pattern in reverse: a physician weaponized legitimate EHR access for commercial purposes, exploiting the informational asymmetry inherent in the custodian-patient relationship. The physician's position within the circle of care created trust that was then betrayed for private gain.\n\n**Therapeutic Implications:**\n- **Trust Erosion**: Parents of newborns are in a vulnerable state. Receiving unsolicited marketing from someone who accessed their child's health records fundamentally undermines trust in the healthcare system.\n- **Informational Asymmetry**: The physician had access to PHI that patients did not know was being used for non-care purposes — a core violation of the transparency principle.\n- **Systemic Signal**: The AMPs ($12,500 total) signal that Ontario takes abuse of access seriously, which therapeutically reinforces that privacy protections have teeth.\n\n**Kawalek's TJ Values Violated**: Respect (using patients as commercial targets), non-coercion (leveraging clinical access for marketing), and clarity (patients had no idea their information was being used this way)."

The doctor denied corrections under s.55(9)(b), claiming the information constituted professional opinions made in good faith. The adjudicator upheld the denial.\n\n**Therapeutic Implications:**\n- **Dignity**: A grieving mother's attempt to correct her son's records is an exercise of relational autonomy — seeking to ensure her son's narrative is accurate even after death. The rigid application of the professional opinion exception, while legally correct, may feel dismissive of profound grief.\n- **Anti-Therapeutic Effects of Rigid Interpretation**: The s.55(9)(b) exception protects clinical judgment, but when applied without therapeutic sensitivity, it can feel like the institution values its own narrative over the family's.\n- **Procedural Justice (Howieson)**: Did the mother feel heard (voice)? Were her concerns validated even if the legal outcome was unfavorable? Was the process perceived as fair and transparent?\n\n**Cerminara's Patient-Centred Analysis**: Even when legal outcomes are unfavorable, therapeutic processes — acknowledging grief, explaining reasoning with empathy, offering alternatives (e.g., a statement of disagreement appended to the record) — can mitigate anti-therapeutic effects."

    "summary": "Maamwesying North Shore Community Health Services (the custodian) reported a privacy breach to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC) under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (the Act).  At the time of the breach, the custodian, in partnership with an Indigenous community, provided health care services at the community\u2019s local health centre.\nIn January 2024, the custodian received lockbox requests from a large number of the community\u2019s patients seeking to restrict chart access by a registered nurse, who was both an agent of the custodian and an employee of that community.  The custodian investigated and determined that the nurse viewed without authorization electronic charts of patients to whom she did not provide care.  Later, the custodian also reported that the nurse disclosed without authorization patients\u2019 personal health information in an offsite meeting between the nurse and other community staff.\nFollowing its investigation into the matter, the custodian found that the nurse viewed patients\u2019 health records without authorization. The custodian removed her access to all electronic medical records and relieved her of her duties. To remediate the breaches, the custodian adopted a new policy to improve training and onboarding for new agents, implemented safeguards for the electronic medical records system and completed initiatives to improve privacy awareness for partner communities.\nIn this case, the IPC investigator finds that, at the time of the breaches, the custodian did not have in place reasonable measures to protect personal health information from unauthorized use and disclosure, as required by section 12 of the Act.  Nevertheless, based on the remedial steps taken, the investigator finds the custodian responded adequately to the breaches and that   further review under Part VI of the Act is not warranted.",
    "citation": "HR24-00118",
    "therapeuticAnalysis": "**TJ Analysis — Lockbox as Therapeutic Instrument & Indigenous Community Privacy:**\nThis decision demonstrates the lockbox mechanism (PHIPA s.17) functioning therapeutically: patients in an Indigenous community used consent directives to protect themselves after discovering unauthorized chart access by a nurse. The pattern of lockbox requests itself triggered the investigation.\n\n**Therapeutic Implications:**\n- **Lockbox as Empowerment**: The patients' collective exercise of lockbox rights represents therapeutic use of privacy law — patients asserting control over their information in response to a violation.\n- **Cultural Safety**: In a close-knit Indigenous community, unauthorized chart access has amplified impacts. The nurse's dual role (agent of custodian AND community employee) blurred boundaries that are already complex in community health settings.\n- **Anti-Therapeutic Pattern #5 (Cultural Insensitivity)**: One-size-fits-all privacy practices may not adequately address collectivist privacy norms in Indigenous communities. Remediation must be culturally appropriate.\n- **Systemic Learning**: The IPC found the custodian initially lacked reasonable safeguards (PHIPA s.12 violation) but responded adequately through remedial steps — new policies, improved onboarding, enhanced privacy awareness for partner communities.\n\n**Howieson's Procedural Justice**: The custodian's transparent response — removing access, investigating, implementing systemic changes — demonstrates procedural justice that can rebuild community trust."

    "summary": "Five hospitals and a health care clinic (collectively, the custodians) reported a privacy breach under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (the Act) involving a ransomware attack against their network operated by a shared IT service provider. The threat actor exfiltrated electronic records containing personal health information of hundreds of thousands of patients and encrypted many network servers. After discovering the attack, the service provider shut down its network and engaged security and forensic experts. The threat actor published the stolen files. The custodians issued public releases about the incident and notified patients whose personal health information was stolen.\nThe threat actor launched its attack by leveraging the network\u2019s administrative accounts.  A forensic investigation could not determine how these accounts were compromised.\nTo remediate the incident, the service provider implemented additional safeguards to reinforce the security of its systems, including increased detection measures, traffic restrictions and multi-factor authentication.\nIn this decision, the investigator finds that the data exfiltration was an unauthorized use and disclosure of personal health information. He also finds that the hostile encryption of the servers resulted in an unauthorized use and loss of personal health information of the custodians\u2019 patients and, therefore, the custodians were required to notify the affected patients as required by section 12(2) of the Act.  The investigator finds that, although the custodians did not notify as required, there is no useful purpose in ordering additional notification in this case.\nIn light of the measures taken to contain, investigate and remediate the incident, the investigator finds that the custodians have responded adequately to the breach and concludes that a review of this matter under Part VI of the Act is not warranted.",

    "summary": "A public hospital reported a privacy breach under PHIPA to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC). The breach involved a radiologist with privileges at the hospital who accessed patients\u2019 health records without authorization. The affected patients included the radiologist\u2019s sister-in-law, who brought the privacy breach to the attention of the hospital, as well as members of her family. \nAs an agent of the hospital, the radiologist\u2019s actions were an inappropriate use of personal health information by the hospital contrary to section 29 of PHIPA which sets out limits on and requirements for the use of this information. \nIn response, the hospital took steps to investigate, contain and remediate the breach. The hospital also provided the appropriate notification in the circumstances, disciplined the radiologist and reported him to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.\nDespite this, the IPC had concerns about the hospital\u2019s ability to detect and deter unauthorized access to patients\u2019 health records in relation to its EHR systems. These systems were not built from a privacy audit perspective and the hospital only became aware of the breach because of a privacy complaint made by the radiologist\u2019s sister-in-law to another regional hospital about him. \nAt the time of the breach, the hospital\u2019s EHR systems had inherent limitations and, generally, did not display a privacy notice or warning flag. For these reasons, the investigator finds that the hospital did not take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances for the security of personal health information against unauthorized use as required by section 12 of PHIPA. However, given the hospital\u2019s response to the breach and implementation of privacy warning flags in its EHR systems, the investigator finds that a formal review of this matter under Part VI of PHIPA is not warranted.",

    "summary": "This matter arises from a community health centre\u2019s report to the IPC about the publication of a magazine article describing the experiences of an unnamed child involved in the child welfare system. The centre identified the child as a recipient of its services, and the article\u2019s author as the partner of a centre employee who provided health care services to the child. The centre asserts that through her involvement in the article, the employee breached the child\u2019s privacy, in violation of the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA).\nIn this decision, the adjudicator finds that the employee breached PHIPA through the improper use of the child\u2019s personal health information in the custody or control of the centre, for purposes unrelated to her duties as an agent of the centre. The resulting magazine article does not contain identifying information of the child that qualifies as \u201cpersonal health information\u201d within the meaning of PHIPA; as a result, its publication was not a disclosure of personal health information to the broader public. In the circumstances, which include the employee\u2019s departure from the centre, the adjudicator declines to make any orders. However, she recommends some changes to the centre\u2019s information practices to address some gaps, including around its agents\u2019 publication of client information.",

    "summary": "In July 2022, the respondent Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) was the subject of an email phishing attack. As a result of the attack, a threat actor gained access to one SMDHU email account containing approximately 20,000 emails, including about 1,000 emails containing personal health information. SMDHU reports that the threat actor\u2019s access to the compromised email account was limited to one hour, and that its forensic analysis found no evidence that the threat actor viewed, downloaded, copied, sent, forwarded, or removed any emails while in the compromised account.\nThe IPC initiated a review of the matter under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA). Section 12(2) of PHIPA sets out a duty on health information custodians like SMDHU to notify individuals at the first reasonable opportunity if their personal health information is stolen, lost, or used or disclosed without authority. SMDHU asserts that there is no evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that any such privacy breach occurred, and on this basis takes the position that the duty to notify does not apply.\nIn this decision, the adjudicator concludes, on a balance of probabilities, that the threat actor\u2019s undisturbed access to an SMDHU email account containing a considerable amount of personal health information resulted in both an unauthorized disclosure and an unauthorized use of personal health information. As a result, the duty to notify in section 12(2) applies. During the IPC review, SMDHU decided to send detailed letter notices to individuals whose personal health information may have been affected by the phishing attack. The adjudicator finds that through its direct notification of individuals during the review, SMDHU provided notice as required by section 12(2) of PHIPA, although it should have done so at the first reasonable opportunity. In the circumstances, she concludes the review without issuing an order.",

    "summary": "In June 2021, the respondent Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health (KFL&A) was the subject of a ransomware attack. The attack resulted in the encryption of multiple KFL&A servers, including those containing personal health information.\nThe IPC initiated a review of the matter under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA). Section 12(2) of PHIPA sets out a duty on health information custodians like KFL&A to notify individuals at the first reasonable opportunity if their personal health information is stolen, lost, or used or disclosed without authority. KFL&A takes the position that the threat actor\u2019s encryption of servers containing personal health information, without evidence of any access to or exfiltration of that information, does not qualify as a theft, loss, or unauthorized use or disclosure of personal health information within the meaning of section 12(2), and that the duty to notify does not apply.\nIn this decision, the adjudicator finds that the threat actor\u2019s encryption of KFL&A servers affected the personal health information in those servers, by making that information unavailable and inaccessible to authorized users. The ransomware attack resulted in both an unauthorized use and a loss of personal health information within the meaning of section 12(2). As a result, KFL&A had a duty under PHIPA to notify affected individuals \u201cat the first reasonable opportunity.\u201d At the time of the incident, KFL&A issued media releases informing the public about the attack, and of the progress of its recovery efforts. While KFL&A\u2019s notice did not comply with section 12(2) because it did not include a statement about the right to complain to the IPC, and ought to have included more detail for the benefit of affected individuals, the adjudicator finds no useful purpose in directing that further notice be given now.

    "summary": "A medical imaging clinic notified the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC) of a breach under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (the Act or PHIPA), following a ransomware attack against the clinic. The threat actor encrypted and exfiltrated files from the electronic medical records and file sharing servers and deleted the clinic\u2019s backups. The clinic shut off the servers immediately, and these remained off while the clinic engaged in discussions with the threat actor. The threat actor provided the clinic with a file tree indicating which files they had exfiltrated, and the clinic ultimately decided to pay the ransom. The clinic was then able to decrypt all information on the affected servers and recover all files. \nThe clinic\u2019s virtual private network kept logs of connections to its systems, but these logs had limited data storage. Because there was so much activity during the attack, the logs ran out of storage and the more recent data wrote over older events. The records from the earlier part of the attack were therefore lost before the clinic could review them. This limited the clinic\u2019s investigation, though they did find that a dormant account belonging to a former internal application developer had been active during the attack. They concluded that this account, which had significant administrative privileges, was used by the threat actor to first gain access to the system and then move to other servers.\nThe clinic posted notices regarding the cyberattack within its physical locations and online. These notices listed the categories of information in the file tree. Later notices also acknowledged that patient medical records were stored in the affected servers, but that there were no signs that these records had been accessed. The clinic clarified to the IPC that its forensic experts examined all files for indications of access by the threat actor. The areas for which there was evidence of access correlated with what the threat actor had set out in its file tree. \nThe clinic revised its guidance to include improved password security, limitation on privileges granted to accounts, deletion of dormant accounts, and improved patch management. It put in place additional security measures, including replacement of the virtual private network with a newer model with enhanced storage to keep logs indefinitely, and extended detection and response capabilities. The clinic now always keeps one backup offline. In light of the steps taken by the clinic to remediate the situation, I have concluded that it is not necessary to pursue a review of this matter under Part VI of the Act.",

    "summary": "The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC) received an anonymous complaint from a group of doctors relating to two research databases created from personal health information, UTOPIAN and POPLAR. The complaint alleged that the personal health information used to populate these databases was obtained from health information custodians without patient consent, and without providing sufficient information to the custodians. The complaint raised concerns about the de-identification of personal health information, and the possibility that such information was being sold or otherwise provided to third parties. The complainants contended that the underlying activity of operating a database of the nature of UTOPIAN and POPLAR was not \u201cresearch\u201d as contemplated by section 44 of the Personal Health Information Protection Act (the Act or PHIPA), and further alleged that even if this was research, the databases did not otherwise meet the requirements of section 44.\nThe IPC contacted the University of Toronto (the University), the operator of UTOPIAN. The University stated that POPLAR had been taken over by Queen\u2019s University and was not yet operational, which Queen\u2019s independently confirmed to the IPC. Accordingly, this investigation in respect of the University focuses on UTOPIAN only. \nThe University provided the IPC with extensive documentation regarding the operation of UTOPIAN. During the course of the investigation, the University stated that it continued to operate its database pursuant to a Protocol Completion Report approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board (REB) after the REB approval for its research plan had expired. Later in this investigation, the University reported that it had paused all UTOPIAN activities and was in the process of applying for REB approval for use of the archived UTOPIAN database for research purposes.   \nIn this decision, I find that the University collected personal health information without authorization under the Act during two periods when its REB approval had lapsed. I also find that the University failed to comply with requirements in s. 44 of the Act in that it failed to provide health information custodians copies of the research plan and its approval decision, failed to make regular site visits as required under the applicable research plan, and failed to provide custodians with notice of the 2018 collections of personal health information that occurred without an REB approval in place. Finally, I find that the University did not amend its research agreements by merely sending custodians notice of its proposed changes, and to the extent that the University collected, used, and retained personal health information beyond what was permitted by the applicable research agreement, this collection, use, and retention contravened section 44 of the Act.\nThe IPC did not find any evidence to substantiate the complainants\u2019 allegations regarding the sale of personal health information, or their de-identification concerns.  However, I recommend that in its new application to the REB relating to UTOPIAN data, the University should update its means of notifying patients regarding the UTOPIAN project, conduct a re-identification study to assess the robustness of its de-identification procedures, and exercise greater transparency with contributing custodians. I also recommend that the University ensure that it has research agreements in place with contributing custodians, including any significant amendments hereto,     and that it complies with the applicable research agreements.",

The hospital granted two corrections related to the date and circumstances of their mother\u2019s death but denied a third related to the cause of death.\nIn this decision, the adjudicator finds that the information the sons want corrected, the impact of their mother\u2019s mental health in her death, is a professional opinion or observation made in good faith by the attending physician, and the section 55(9)(b) exception to the duty to correct therefore applies. He upholds the decision of the hospital and dismisses the complaint.",

The physician released several records to the complainant, but denies that she held those records in the capacity of a health care provider to the complainant. The complainant filed a PHIPA complaint against the physician based on a belief that the physician has additional records to which the complainant has a right of access under PHIPA.\nIn this decision, the adjudicator concludes that the physician is not governed by PHIPA in respect of the records the complainant seeks; accordingly, there is no right of access under PHIPA to such records if they exist. As there are no reasonable grounds to review the matter under PHIPA, the adjudicator dismisses the complaint.",

The hospital identified and released a number of records, but the complainant believed there ought to be more. She filed an appeal under FIPPA in respect of the hospital\u2019s search for records and the completeness of the records released to her. In this decision, the adjudicator finds that the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA), which also applies the hospital, is the relevant statute governing the issues raised by the complainant. The adjudicator finds that the hospital conducted a reasonable search for records in accordance with its obligations under PHIPA, which are analogous to those applicable to the hospital under FIPPA. As there is no reasonable basis to believe that additional searches would yield responsive records, the adjudicator dismisses the complaint without issuing an order.",

The access request was for a copy of the requester\u2019s health records, including any records relating to ethics reviews of the requester\u2019s time spent confined or in seclusion at Waypoint. Waypoint denied access to portions of these records, claiming the application of section 52(1)(f)(ii)(A) of the Act, allowing it to withhold information under the exemption in section 49(a) FIPPA, read with the discretionary solicitor-client privilege exemption in section 19 of FIPPA.

    "summary": "A public hospital notified the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC) of a breach under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (the Act), as there had been a cyberattack against the hospital. After the hospital self-reported the breach, the IPC opened a file relating to this breach, and subsequently received four complaints from affected individuals. During the cyberattack, the threat actor accessed numerous hospital systems, via a password-spraying attack that compromised an account with privileged access. The hospital took immediate steps to disable the affected accounts and fix the firewall issue that had allowed for the access to occur.  The hospital found that the threat actor had exfiltrated large amounts of information, but was not able to determine the exact data that had been taken. The hospital did determine the types of personal health information that may have been accessed, and estimated the number of patients who may have been affected. The hospital provided public notice of the breach, and has agreed to continue to monitor the dark web for two years for any activity relating to this breach.  \n \nThe hospital provided the IPC with numerous guidelines in place addressing information security, all of which were revised following the cyberattack. These included guidance on strength of passwords, limitation on privileges granted to accounts, and firewall protections. The hospital also provided the IPC with a breach protocol specific to cybersecurity incidents, which was put in place following the incident. In light of the steps taken by the hospital to remediate the situation, including the guidance now in place, I have concluded that it is not necessary to pursue a review of this matter under Part VI of the Act.",

The request was for the complainant\u2019s son\u2019s entire file while on a particular ward and correspondence about him exchanged between any and all employees at the hospital. The hospital granted partial access to the information, denying access to portions of the records under both PHIPA and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). The hospital claimed the exemptions at section 52(1)(a) of PHIPA (legal privilege) and sections 13(1) (advice and recommendations) and 21(1) (personal privacy) of FIPPA. In addition to objecting to the denial of access to portions of the records, the complainant took issue with the reasonableness of the hospital\u2019s search for responsive records.",

    "summary": "The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) received complaints from students at the University of Waterloo (the university) regarding \u201csmart\u201d snack vending machines installed on campus by a third-party service provider. The complaints alleged that the machines appeared to use facial recognition technology that was collecting facial images without consent or proper notice. In this report, I find that the machines used cameras and face detection technology to capture identifiable facial images amounting to a collection of personal information within the meaning of section 38(1) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Further, I find that this collection did not comply with section 38(2) of FIPPA and, therefore, was a privacy breach. I also find that affected individuals were not given notice of the collection, as required under section 39(2) of FIPPA. Although the university had reasonable contractual safeguards in place with the third-party service provider, it was unaware that personal information was being collected through the machines\u2019 face detection technology. This oversight was due to shortcomings in the university\u2019s procurement process for the vending machines which failed to apply the necessary level of due diligence by conducting a privacy impact assessment, or requiring prospective service providers to do so, in order to identify and assess the privacy implications of the technology. In this report, I recommend that the university take adequate steps in the procurement process to ensure it evaluates third-party service providers and any technology to be used, and fulfills its obligations to protect personal information under its control in accordance with section 4(1) of Regulation 460 under FIPPA.\nIn this report, I find that the machines used cameras and face detection technology to capture identifiable facial images amounting to a collection of personal information within the meaning of section 38(1) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).

    "summary": "The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the IPC) received a complaint about McMaster University\u2019s (McMaster or the university) use of Respondus exam proctoring software under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA or the Act). The software comprises two programs. Respondus LockDown Browser limits what users can access on their computers and Respondus Monitor analyzes audio and video of students during the exam to scan for possible cheating. The complainant did not want the IPC to provide their name and complaint to the university, so the IPC opened this Commissioner-initiated complaint to address the university\u2019s use of this exam proctoring software. \n \nThis report concludes that conducting exams and appointing examiners is a lawfully authorized activity of the university.  Proctoring exams online to ensure their integrity is an appropriate component of conducting certain types of exams and is therefore also a lawfully authorized activity. On the question of whether the collection of personal information through the use of Respondus exam proctoring software is necessary to proctor exams, I find that Respondus LockDown Browser collects little personal information, and only collects and uses what it needs to function. Respondus Monitor collects more sensitive personal information, including biometric information, and uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which carries heightened concerns. Because the personal information collected by Respondus Monitor on behalf of the university is necessary for that tool to fulfill its function of exam proctoring, it is authorized under section 38(2) of the Act. However, the university has not provided adequate notice for its collection of personal information as required by section 39(2) of the Act and the use of students\u2019 personal information through Respondus Monitor is not in compliance with section 41(1).  Moreover, the current contractual arrangement between the university and Respondus is contrary to section 41(1) of the Act in so far as it does not adequately protect all of the personal information collected and allows Respondus to use personal information for system improvement purposes without the consent of students.",

The children\u2019s aid society stated that the OPP had implemented new reporting system software (Child Protection Agency Notification Plug-in) and since that time, had sent several occurrence reports in which a youth was listed a witness or victim of a serious crime, but where there was no indication of a child protection concern.

As a result of privacy concerns and the related safety issues raised by the article, the IPC initiated a privacy investigation under the Act with respect to the information being disclosed on this web site. The investigation found that the web site and related phone system disclosed personal information, and that these disclosures are not authorized by section 32 of the Act. In addition, these disclosures have the potential to seriously threaten the safety of students. The IPC recommended both be dismantled.",

PC-040077-1 and PC-040078-1 Institutions: Management Board Secretariat (PC-040077-1) Ministry of Finance (PC-040078-1) Summary of Commissioner-Initiated Investigation: On December 3, 2004, the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (the IPC) was notified by the Ministry of Finance (the Ministry) about a breach of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). The Ministry advised that the privacy breach occurred with its November 30, 2004 mail-out of the Ontario Child Care Supplement cheques, which are mailed out on a monthly basis. The Ministry advised that each of the approximately 27,000 cheques mailed out contained the recipient's name, address, amount paid and social insurance number (SIN), along with four additional digits directly following the SIN. The counter-foil (the cheque stub) contained the name and SIN of the recipient as well as the name, address, and the SIN, along with four additional digits, of another recipient. The Ministry advised that the cheques were printed at the iSERV data centre in Downsview and mailed out for the Ministry by the Shared Services Bureau (the SSB) of Management Board Secretariat (MBS). That same day, the IPC also received a second telephone call in relation to the incident, this time from MBS. MBS confirmed that the cheques were printed by iSERV, a program area for which MBS is responsible, and that MBS was investigating the circumstances leading to the privacy breach. MBS stated that it was now double-checking the cheques printed by iSERV for other programs, prior to mailing them out. Both the Ministry and MBS expressed their concerns over the privacy breach and assured us of their intention to co-operate fully with our investigation, which they have done. The IPC initiated privacy investigations under the Act with MBS (PC-040077-1) and the Ministry (PC-040078-1). Both investigations are addressed in this report since the privacy breach involved both the Ministry and MBS. Background The Ontario government has a number of programs that involve mailing cheques to individuals. The cheques for some programs, such as the Ontario Child Care Supplement for Working Families (OCCS) Program and the Ontario Disability Support Program, are printed at the iSERV data centre in Downsview. However, the cheques for other programs may be printed at a limited number of government buildings. Regardless of the government program, the process for printing and mailing cheques follows a common chain of events that typically involve the Office of the Provincial Controller (OPC), SSB, and the iSERV data centre in Downsview. For the OCCS program, the Ministry of Finance first prepares an electronic program file. This file contains data that will ultimately be printed out on each cheque, such as the name, address and identifying number (which includes the social insurance number) of an OCCS recipient. Each cheque includes a stub with similar data that would typically be detached and retained by the recipient before he or she deposited or cashed the cheque at a bank or other financial institution. The Ministry electronically transmits the OCCS program file to a \"holding\" s",

    "summary": "SUMMARY OF COMMISSIONER INITIATED COMPLAINT: The Office of the Information and Privacy Comissioner/Ontario (the IPC) was contacted by Management Board Secretariat (MBS) regarding a disclosure of personal information relating to the Ontario Student Award Program (OSAP) by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities and a private collection agency. Subsequently, this Office was contacted by MBS regarding a second disclosure of personal information relating to the same program by another private collection agency. On the basis of this information, the IPC initiated two privacy complaints under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). Background The first complaint involves the Student Support Branch of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (the Ministry), and both complaints involve the Collections Management Unit (CMU) of the Shared Services Bureau (SSB) of MBS. The Student Support Branch of the Ministry manages OSAP, a program of student financial assistance administered by the Ministry and composed of a variety of programs funded by the province of Ontario and the government of Canada. The CMU manages the collection of overdue non-tax debts owing to the government, by hiring private sector debt collection agencies to undertake the collection of unpaid debts on behalf of the Ontario government. When a debtor defaults on the repayment of an OSAP loan and the Ministry is unable to settle the account with the debtor, the Ministry refers the debt to the CMU at MBS for collection, and these accounts are then assigned by the CMU to private collection agencies. Particulars of the two incidents In the first complaint, PA-040033-1, a private collection agency retained by MBS received a request from a debtor for supporting information about her student loan. In response, the agency forwarded the request to the Ministry, which in turn sent a copy of a bulk report prepared by a bank to the agency. The agency then forwarded this report to the debtor. However, the report contained the personal information of thirty- eight other individuals in addition to that of the debtor. In the second instance, PA-040044-1, another private collection agency mailed information to a debtor regarding her student loan and inadvertently enclosed the personal information of another debtor in the envelope. In both instances, MBS was made aware of the incidents by the two recipients of the records. The personal information in the records at issue included the student debtors\u2019 names, social insurance numbers (SIN) and details regarding the student loans. Actions taken in response to these incidents PC-040033-1 Management Board Secretariat MBS advised that it undertook the following steps to address this incident. On receipt of the telephone call from the debtor\u2019s mother advising that her daughter had received a record from a collection agency retained by MBS containing the personal information of individuals other than her daughter, staff in the SSB alerted senior management in the CMU, and obtained the debtor\u2019s written consent for the SSB to communicate with her mother on this issue. A client services officer in the CMU then contacted the mother, who confirmed that her daughter received a record containing the names, social insurance numbers and details of the loans relating to 38 other individuals. The record was sent to the daughter by a private collection agency retained by the CMU. This information was provided to her daughter as a result of a request for supporting information from the Ministry regarding the daughter\u2019s outstanding OSAP loan. At MBS\u2019 request, the mother faxed the record to the CMU, and advised that she would shred her copy. Subsequently, MBS arranged to pick up the record by courier and has since returned it to the Ministry. The CMU then contacted the collection agency, which confirmed that it sent the information at issue to the daughter. It also confirmed that it had originally received this record from the Ministry. The CMU also contacted the Student Support Branch of the Ministry, which confirmed that the record was sent to the collection agency by the Ministry. The Ministry indicated that the record is one of a series of quarterly statements prepared for the years 1996 and 1997 for a particular bank identifying individuals who have participated in the interest relief program. The record identifies 38 individuals including the recipient. It contains the individuals\u2019 social insurance number, given name and surname, and other details of the loans relating to these individuals. MBS notes that it has established comprehensive contractual provisions in its contracts with the PCA [private collection agency] agents it retains in order to protect the personal information that is collected, used and disclosed in the course of debt collection... at the behest of the CMU all [staff at the collection agency] were reminded that when receiving back-up information about debtors from Ministries they must conduct a thorough review of all documents to ensure that only the personal information of the debtor is mailed out; the CMU, the MBS legal services branch, and the Access and Privacy Office of MBS [conducted] a comprehensive privacy training session for staff of all PCAs retained by the CMU.[...] A training session [was] conducted for staff in the [CMU]. Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities The Ministry advised that it undertook the following steps to address this incident. Specifically it sent letters to all 38 individuals, advising them that as the result of a mailing error, their personal information (name, social insurance number and the principal and interest of their OSAP loan) was inadvertently sent to another individual. The director of Student Support Branch, who signed the letter, apologized for the breach, stated that the record had been returned without being copied, and provided the name and telephone number of the Senior Manager of Operations as a contact person to provide them with additional information. We also informed the individuals that the ministry has changed the process by which banks and collection agencies report on OSAP loans and we have enhanced internal measures to protect client privacy. The letters were sent by registered mail to the most recent address that the ministry could obtain for each of the individuals. However, many of these addresses are several years old. To date, 21 of the letters have been returned to the ministry. These letters are being kept in the files of the individuals concerned. The Ministry indicated that in light of this incident, it has reviewed its policies and procedures and made the following changes: The processes under which disclosure of personal information is made to private collection agencies, upon request for proof of an OSAP debt, has been enhanced. Before disclosure is made by a financial services clerk, the disclosure is re",

    "summary": "INTRODUCTION This report deals with two privacy investigations involving the Ministry of the Attorney General (the Ministry). Both stem from incidents involving the disclosure of personal information as a consequence of computer theft. In both instances the police were notified of the theft, but neither computer has been recovered. Both investigations remain ongoing. BACKGROUND Privacy Investigation #1 - PC-000026-1 On August 4, 2000, the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (the IPC) received a letter from a Director from one Division of the Ministry regarding the theft of a portable computer containing litigation documents. The letter stated: On Thursday August 3, 2000 a portable computer containing information related to litigation conducted by counsel from [the Ministry] was stolen. The computer was locked in the trunk of the lawyer's automobile and was removed while the vehicle was in an underground parking area. The police have been notified and I am advised that efforts are underway to recover this stolen property. As the data on the computer includes some personal information, [the Deputy Attorney General] requested that I notify you of this matter. Also, please be advised that office policies with respect to the security of portable computers are under review and all staff will be reminded of their obligation to secure personal information. ... On the basis of this letter, the IPC initiated Privacy Investigation PC-000026-1, pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). Privacy Investigation #2 - PC-010009-1 On February 21, 2001, the IPC received a letter from the Ministry's Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Criminal Law Division, which stated: On February 14, 2001, a laptop belonging to an Assistant Crown Attorney was stolen from the locked trunk of his car in Durham Region. It appears to have been stolen when he stopped at a Shopper's Drug Mart on his way home from work. I have been advised that there was personal information, and also information of a sensitive nature stored in the C drive of the computer. The computer was not password protected. There are inquiries being made regarding the extent to which the information was backed up so we can determine who ought to be notified of the incident. The Criminal Law Division is reviewing current practices regarding the transportation of files in an effort to enhance security measures. Crowns have recently been reminded not to leave laptops and files unattended. We will take immediate steps to ensure that all laptops in the Criminal Law Division are password protected in an effort to ensure that should such an unfortunate event occur in the future, the information stored on the computer would be inaccessible. ... As a result, the IPC initiated Privacy Investigation, PC-010009-1 under the Act . RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION The first two priorities when faced with a potential disclosure of personal information are: (1) to identify the scope of the potential disclosure and take steps to contain it; and (2) to identify those individuals whose personal information may have been disclosed and, barring exceptional circumstances, to notify those individuals accordingly. Although the circumstances which lead to Privacy Investigations #1 and #2 were very similar in nature, the approach taken by the Ministry in addressing these two priorities differed significantly. Privacy Investigation #1 - PC-000026-1 The Ministry initially advised the IPC that the stolen computer contained a very large number of documents relating to a specific litigation matter. No details were provided. The Ministry informed the IPC that the lawyer whose laptop was stolen was of the view that the only personal information contained in the electronic records stored on the computer consisted of the names and home telephone numbers of certain public servants. On August 9, 2000, the Director who authored the August 4, 2000 letter to the IPC sent an e-mail to her staff advising them of the stolen laptop and reminding them to \"take laptops directly home from the office\" and to \"ensure that access to documents stored on the laptop is password protected.\" On August 28, 2000, the Ministry's Freedom of Information and Privacy Co-ordinator (the Co-ordinator) provided the Director with a copy of the IPC Practices entitled \"Privacy and Confidentiality When Working Outside the Office\" and asked her to distribute it to the staff of the branch. The IPC advised the Ministry that it required more information in order to determine whether the actions taken by the Ministry adequately addressed basic privacy concerns. Specifically, the IPC asked the Ministry to provide more information concerning: the type of records at issue; the scope and type of personal information at issue; and the identity of the individuals whose personal information was contained in the records. IPC staff offered to meet with the lawyer, but the Ministry declined. The Ministry provided a general description of the types of records at issue, but no further details concerning the particulars of the case or the individuals involved. The Ministry subsequently explained that the records contained privileged information that could not be divulged to the IPC, but that some remedial steps had been taken by the Ministry to prevent similar incidents in future. As an initial investigative step, the IPC decided to focus our efforts in the following two areas: ensuring that all public servants whose personal information was included in the records had been notified by the Ministry; and ensuring that a privacy expert from the Ministry personally reviewed the hard-copy version of each record contained on the stolen computer to confirm that no other personal information was contained in any of them. The Ministry promptly confirmed that the notifications relating to the first item had been sent by the lawyer during the week of September 7, 2000. As far as the second item was concerned, the Ministry took until December 22, 2000 to complete the review, almost 5 months after the theft of the computer had been reported. Further, although the review was apparently completed on December 22, 2000, the IPC was not advised of the results of the review until February 2, 2001. In response to persistent enquiries from the IPC, the Ministry finally confirmed that the review had been completed, and advised us for the first time at that point that additional personal information had been identified in the records. The Ministry informed the IPC that internal consultations were underway to address this situation. On February 22, 2001, the Deputy Attorney General wrote to the Commissioner outlining a number of steps the Ministry had taken to prevent similar situations from arising in future, which are discussed later in this report. As far as the specific records at issue in Privacy Investigation #1 were concerned, the Ministry stated: ... during the week of September 2, 2000, the public servants whose personal information was included in t",

    "summary": "INTRODUCTION: Background of the Complaint Letter #1 A resident of the Township of Springwater (the Township) filed an objection with the Township Clerk concerning certain proposed development activity under consideration by the Township. The Clerk referred the objection to the Township's Chief Administrative Officer, who in turn raised the matter with a planner employed by the developer (the developer's planner). After receiving a response from the developer's planner, the matter was discussed at a closed session of the Township Council and referred to the Township's Solicitor and outside planning consultant (the outside planning consultant) for further action. Letter #2 The resident filed a second objection with the Township concerning a re-zoning application under consideration by the Township. The Township Council referred this matter to the Snow Valley Working Group (the Working Group), an organization whose membership included the developer's planner who is the subject of letter #1. The resident (now the complainant) sent a letter of complaint to this Office, alleging that the Township had improperly disclosed his personal information to the developer's planner and to the outside planning consultant (letter #1) and to the Working Group (letter #2), contrary to the provisions of the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). The complainant's letter also identified three other matters which, as explained by the mediator, fall outside the scope of this investigation. Issues Arising from the Investigation The following issues were identified as arising from the investigation: (A) Was the information in question \"personal information\"as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? (B) Did the Township disclose personal information relating to letter #1 and, if so, was this disclosure in accordance with section 32 of the Act ? (C) Did the Township disclose personal information relating to letter #2 and, if so, was this disclosure in accordance with section 32 of the Act ? RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION: Issue A: Was the information in question \"personal information\" as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? Section 2(1) of the Act states, in part: \"personal information\" means recorded information about an identifiable individual, including, (e) the personal opinions or views of the individual except if they relate to another individual, (f) correspondence sent to an institution by the individual that is implicitly or explicitly of a private or confidential nature, and replies to that correspondence that would reveal the contents of the original correspondence, The two letters of objection submitted to the Township by the complainant contain his name, address, telephone and fax number, as well as his views and opinions regarding development issues under consideration by the Township. As such, I find that the information contained in the two letters falls within the scope of paragraph (e), and therefore qualifies as the complainant's personal information. Conclusion : The information in question was personal information as defined in section 2(1) of the Act . Issue B: Did the Township disclose personal information relating to letter #1 and, if so, was this disclosure in accordance with section 32 of the Act ? The complainant maintains that letter #1 was disclosed to the developer's planner by the Township's Chief Administrative Officer, and subsequently to the outside planning consultant following consideration by the Township Council. The complainant does not indicate any objection to disclosure to the Township Solicitor. The Township denies that letter #1 was disclosed. It takes the position that the subject matter of the complainant's concerns was discussed with the developer's planner, but the actual letter was not disclosed. According to the Township, the complainant's identity was not revealed to the developer's planner during the course of these discussions. I have reviewed the summary of the content of the complainant's first objection that was prepared by the Township's Chief Administrative Officer and provided by him to the developer's planner, as well as the response provided by the developer's planner. This exchange of correspondence did not identify the complainant or disclose any of the complainant's personal information. There is nothing in the content of these letters to suggest that the developer's planner was aware of the identity of the complainant or any of his personal information. Although the complainant holds the view, based on actions taken by the developer and informal discussions with other individuals during the relevant time period, that his identity was disclosed by the Township, I am unable to conclude, based on information provided to me during the course of this investigation, that letter #1 was disclosed to the developer's planner. The explanation offered by the Township is reasonable and it would appear that the nature of the complainant's objection, but not his identity or other personal information, was disclosed to the developer's planner, as suggested by the Township. As far as the outside planning consultant is concerned, the Township acknowledges that letter #1 was provided to him, as directed by Township Council. This issue is whether or not this disclosure was in compliance with section 32 of the Act . Section 32 lists a number of permitted disclosures of personal information, including section 32(c) which states: An institution shall not disclose personal information in its custody or under its control except, <",

DISCUSSION: During the investigation, the following information was obtained as a result of discussions with the London Police's Freedom of Information Coordinator (\"FOI Co-ordinator\") and written materials provided to our office. Background London Police had received a request under the Act for a copy of an occurrence report. The individual requesting the report (the \"requester\") indicated to London Police that he was only interested in the information in the report that pertained to him and that he was not interested in information pertaining to other individuals. As a result, London Police decided to release to the requester a severed version of the report, deleting the personal information of individuals other than the requester. Having prepared the severed version of the report, London Police subsequently notified the requester that his records package was ready and that he could come by any time during office hours to pick up the package. London Police's procedures require that the Freedom of Information Analyst (the \"FOI Analyst\") place the records being released to a requester in an envelope together with the decision letter, and then place the envelope in the bottom shelf of the filing cabinet. The procedures also require that the person retrieving the package from the filing cabinet check the contents of the package to ensure that what is being released is in fact the severed copy. In this case, when the requester attended at London Police's office to pick up his package, it was lunch hour and both the FOI Co-ordinator and FOI Analyst were out of the office. An individual from the Records Department, who fills in at reception when the usual back up person is not available, was handling the reception desk. When the receptionist went to retrieve the package from the filing cabinet, she found the requester's file containing both the severed and unsevered report, but no records package for the requester. The receptionist tried to contact the FOI Analyst at home, but could not reach her. She also tried to contact the individual who usually fills in at reception, but could not reach her either. The receptionist ultimately decided to prepare the records package herself, rather than ask the requester to wait or return later. She placed both the unsevered and severed copy of the occurrence report in an envelope, which she then gave to the requester. The FOI Analyst and Co-ordinator learned of the error when they returned to the office about an hour later. Steps Taken by London Police Upon learning of the error, the FOI Co-ordinator immediately instructed the FOI Analyst to call the requester and advise that they would be sending a police officer to the requester's residence to retrieve the package. Upon receiving the call, the requester volunteered to personally return the package. About 30 minutes later, the requester attended at London Police's office and returned the package. The FOI Co-ordinator also contacted the IPC that same day to advise of the incident. In a follow up conversation the next day, the IPC suggested that the FOI Co-ordinator specifically ask the requester whether he had viewed or had copied the unsevered document and whether he would be willing to swear an affidavit. The FOI Co-ordinator later called the requester, who advised her that he had neither viewed nor copied the documents and further indicated that he was willing to swear an affidavit to that effect. The requester did later swear an affidavit, stating that during the time the documents were in his possession and prior to returning them to London Police, they remained in his personal automobile and that he did not have the opportunity to view them. London Police indicated that based on this affidavit, no personal information had been disclosed to the requester and no benefit would be served in notifying the individuals whose information had been contained in the report. In addition to the above steps, the FOI Co-ordinator obtained reports from",

    "summary": "SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT: This investigation was initiated as a result of a complaint under the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ) that Prince Edward-Lennox and Addington Social Services (Social Services) had improperly disclosed the personal information of a client. Specifically, the complainant reported that a caseworker copied the Children's Aid Society on a letter the caseworker sent to her, which contained the complainant's personal information. DISCUSSION: The complainant receives money through the Ontario Works program and as a condition of receiving benefits, the complainant was asked to verify that her former spouse was not residing with her; however, the Social Services worker did not receive the verification prior to the May 25 cut-off date for processing recipients' ongoing direct bank deposits. On May 28, 2001 the caseworker wrote to the complainant, outlining the concerns around the possibility of her former spouse residing with her, suggested that the complainant had provided false information to Ontario Works and noted that her assistance would be delayed. She also indicated that because of a concern for the complainant's children, Social Services was obliged to advise the Children's Aid Society, which they did by way of a copy of this letter. The Social Services indicated to the Mediator that they provided this information to the Children's Aid Society in compliance with section 72 of the Child and Family Services Act , \"duty to report child in need of protection\". CONCLUSION: The Child and Family Services Act requires an individual who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is in need of protection, to report the suspicion and the information on which it is based to a Children's Aid Society. It is the complainant's lawyer's position that the caseworker disclosed personal information of the complainant beyond what was required by the legislation. The County does not dispute this. In fact, the Director of the Prince Edward-Lennox and Addington Social Services has provided a letter to the complainant's lawyer, with a copy to the Mediator, in which he acknowledges that \"I agree that information provided to Family and Children's Services contained both necessary information as well as some extraneous information. I regret the inclusion of this extraneous information and staff have been advised in similar future cases, to develop a separate communique to other agencies such as Family and Children's Services\". He also offered his apologies to the complainant. In discussions with the mediator, the Director has indicated that a different letter will be issued to the CAS in any future instance, ensuring that only relevant information is disclosed. I recommend that the Director continue to ensure that all social services staff are aware of how the principles of the Act apply to the collection and disclosure of personal information. The complaint file is now closed. Original signed by: Leslie McIntyre, Mediator November 5, 2001",

    "summary": "SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT: The complainant owned property in the Municipality of Bayham (the Municipality) and was allegedly in arrears of property taxes. The Municipality initiated formal proceedings to collect the arrears owing. The complainant claims that in December of 2000 she became aware that a Final Notice of Registration of Tax Arrears Certificate (final notice) and Tax Arrears Certificate - Document General (certificate) was sent to a law firm that had formerly acted for the complainant and her husband. The final notice and certificate (which I will refer to collectively as the \"notice\") contained information pertaining to the property, including the address, a legal description of the property, the assessment roll number and the amount allegedly owing in tax arrears. The notices do not contain the complainant's name. Upon further inquiry, the complainant discovered that the Municipality had sent out notices to 13 addressees. The addressees consisted of parties that the Municipality believed had an interest in the property including the complainant, the complainant's spouse, mortgagees, mortgage guarantors and various law firms. Of these, the complainant contends that only five had any interest in the identified property, and would thereby be entitled to receive such notices under section 11(1) of the Municipal Tax Sales Act (MTSA) . The complainant alleges that her personal information was inappropriately disclosed to the remaining eight addressees, contrary to the Act. Of the eight, six addressees were various law firms that have represented interested parties and the remaining two addressees consisted of a corporation that allegedly no longer had an interest in the property, and the law firm that represented them. The mediator and the Municipality corresponded on a number of occasions in regard to the complaint. It was acknowledged that the Municipality did in fact send the 13 notices alleged by the complainant. The Municipality had hired an outside consultant to handle its tax sales. This consultant sought and obtained a legal opinion in regard to the legality of sending the notices to persons other than those who have an interest in the property - namely solicitors who prepared documents registered on title. The Municipality indicated that the legal opinion advised that, although the Municipality is not required to do so, it would be a good practice to notify these other parties given that a common objection to property tax sales is the allegation of no notice being provided to the interested parties. Despite the legal opinion, the Municipality agreed that it would alter its policy, and would now send notices only to those who had an interest in the property. Notices would be sent to lawyers listed on the registered documents only if the interested parties' addresses were unknown. The Municipality's position in regard to the privacy complaint is threefold. Firstly, the Municipality contends that the information contained in the Notices does not meet the definition of \"personal information\" as set out in the Act . The Municipality claims that none of the notices contained the name of the complainant except those that contained the complainant's name as addressee (i.e. notices sent to her directly, or sent to her in \"care of\" a law firm). Therefore, the Municipality asserts that the information in the notices is information about the property. They claim the notices do not disclose a financial transaction involving the individual complainant since the individual's name did not appear in conjunction with the other personal information. Secondly, the Municipality claims that the information is generally available to the public for a fee. They rely on section 415(1) of the Municipal Act which states that the Municipal Treasurer is obligated \"on demand\" to give a written certified statement of the arrears due on any land to any person. The Municipality also notes that MTSA proceedings are open to the public. The Municipality asserts that there is nothing confidential about these records and that the records are truly available to the general public. Thirdly, it is the Municipality's position that the MTSA does not prohibit the sending of the Notices to the solicitors, and that it may, in fact, be a prudent practice. The Municipality claims that the Notices were sent to the solicitors in good faith to ensure that those parties with an interest in the property did in fact receive notice. It is the Municipality's agent's normal practice to conduct a search of title for the purpose of identifying all registered interests against title and then proceeds to issue Notices to all interested parties at every address, including their solicitor's address as shown in the most recent addition of the Ontario Lawyer's Phone Book. The Municipality's arguments raise the possible application of section 27 of the Act , which indicates that the privacy rules in Part II of the Act do not apply to informat",

    "summary": "INTRODUCTION: Background of the Complaint The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner received a complaint submitted by counsel on behalf of a client (the complainant), to the effect that the complainant's privacy had been breached by staff of the Toronto Police Services Board (the Police). The complainant alleges that a detective in the Toronto Homicide Squad contacted his father. In the course of speaking with the father, the complainant maintains that the detective revealed that the complainant was HIV positive. According to the complainant, prior to that conversation, his father did not know his medical status. The complainant also states that he did not consent to the disclosure of his medical information to his family by the Police. The complainant has presumed that the detective came into possession of information about him through the detective's professional duties, and alleges that such a disclosure contravenes the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). Issues Arising from the Investigation The following issues were identified as arising from the investigation: (A) Was the information in question \"personal information\" as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? (B) Was the disclosure of the complainant's personal information made in accordance with section 32 of the Act ? RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION: Issue A: Was the information in question \"personal information\" as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? Under section 2(1) of the Act, personal information is defined in part as recorded information about an identifiable individual, including information relating to the medical history of the individual. Clearly, the information at issue, the medical status of the complainant, falls within the scope of the definition of \"personal information\" in section 2(1) of the Act . The Police do not dispute this finding. Conclusion: The personal information at issue is the personal information of the complainant, as defined in section 2(1) of the Act . Issue B: Was the disclosure of the complainant's personal information made in accordance with section 32 of the Act ? During our investigation, the Mediator contacted the complainant's father, who indicated that the conversation with the detective took place in a courtroom in February 2000, during a trial involving the complainant's brother. The detective had been the arresting officer in this case. According to the father, the detective asked him if he had seen the complainant, and when the father indicated that he believed him to be in another province, the detective informed him that in fact, he was in the Don Jail, and that he was HIV positive. The Freedom of Information Co-ordinator (the Co-ordinator) for the Police questioned the detective about the circumstances identified by the complainant. According to the Co-ordinator, the detective agreed that he had spoken to the complainant's father during the course of the investigation and subsequent trial, but denied disclosing any medical information about the complainant. The detective is of the view that the complainant's medical status was well-known, and states that he would have had no reason to discuss it with the father. The Police also note that the complainant's medical information had been disclosed during court proceedings prior to February 2000, and suggest the possibility that the father learned about the complainant's medical status from another source. The Police state: [The complainant's] HIV status had been stated in open court on at least one previous occasion. Although this fact may not justify a Service member releasing such sensitive information to a third party, it does suggest that the complainant's HIV status would have been known by several individuals (in attendance at court that day) any one of whom may have been in contact with the father. It is not possible to determine with certainty which version of events is correct. In my view, the explanation offered by the Police is reasonable and, based on the information provided by the complainant and the Police, I am not persuaded that the detective disclosed the client's personal information in the manner described by the father. That being said, if the disclosure was made by the detective as described by the father, it would constitute an improper disclosure, and would not be in compliance with section 32 of the Act . Conclusion: I am not persuaded that there was an improper disclosure of the complainant's personal information. In response to receiving a draft version of this report, counsel for the complainant submits that a third issue needs to be addressed. Specifically, the complainant states: Under [the Act ], sections 41 through 44 create a mechanism whereby the Commissioner can hear appeals regarding refusals of access and amendment requests. Those sections give the Commissioner the necessary powers to address those appeals. In particular, section 41(8) gives the Commissioner the power to examine any person under oath, and section 41(4) gives the parties the right to counsel. There is no similar scheme for complainants involved allegations of wrongful disclosures. Under the Act , the only powers the Commissioner has to address complaints regarding wrongful disclosures are contained in section 46. Section 46 does not give the Commissioner any investigative powers, not does it even give the Commissioner the right to order a head to cease disclosing information in contravention of the legislation. There is no general right to investigate, no powers to compel production or evidence, no power to hold an oral hearing. As a result, the Act creates a scheme whereby the Commissioner has virtually no ability to properly investigate complainants of wrongful disclosu",

    "summary": "INTRODUCTION Background of the Complaint This investigation was initiated as a result of a complaint concerning a municipal town (the Town). The complainant was suspended from his position as the Town's chief of police. During his suspension, the complainant applied for employment with a city (the City). When making this application to the City, the complainant did not provide anyone from the Town as a reference, and the Town was not aware that he had made such an application. However, according to the complainant, the City contacted the Town and the Town disclosed his salary and the fact that he had been suspended as chief of police. The complainant was concerned that the Town's disclosure of his salary and suspension to the City, without his consent, was contrary to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act ). Issues Arising from the Investigation The following issues were identified as arising from the investigation: (A) Was the information in question \"personal information\", as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? If yes, (B) Was the specific personal information disclosed by the Town? (C) Did section 27 of the Act apply to the complainant's personal information that he had been suspended? (D) Was the complainant's personal information that he had been suspended disclosed in compliance with section 32 of the Act ? RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION Issue A: Was the information in question \"personal information\", as defined in section 2(1) of the Act ? Section 2(1) of the Act states that personal information \"means recorded information about an identifiable individual\". The information in question was the complainant's salary and the fact that he had been suspended as chief of police by the Town. While the complainant's name was not specifically mentioned in the telephone conversation between the Town and the City, he was referred to as the \"chief of police\" and was, therefore, an identifiable individual. It is our view that the information in question met the requirements of the definition of personal information in section 2(1) of the Act . Conclusion: The information in question was personal information as defined in section 2(1) of the Act . Issue B: Was the specific personal information disclosed by the Town? The complainant stated that his actual salary and the fact that he was suspended had been disclosed by the Town. Both the City and the Town agreed that the Town had disclosed the fact that the complainant had been suspended. The Town had advised the City that \"no negotiation had been undertaken recently due to the current Chief's suspension\". However, with respect to the complainant's salary information, the Town stated that, when the City requested information regarding the salary \"Classes\" for the chief of police, the Town advised the City that it did not understand the request for \"Classes\", and that \"the Chief's salary was in a specified range and that there were four classes of constables included in the range of salaries quoted...from mid-forty to mid fifty-five thousand range.\" The Town maintained that it did not tell the City \"specific dollar amounts\", nor did it refer to the complainant or to his salary directly; \"at no time was [the complainant's] name or salary mentioned during the conversation in question.\" The City advised us that the Town stated that the Town did not have ranges of salaries. The City said that it was not given a salary range nor was it given the complainant's actual salary. Both the City and the Town agreed that the complainant's actual salary had not been disclosed. However, based upon the conflicting information provided to us by the Town and the City, we are unable to determine whether the complainant's salary range was disclosed by the Town. Conclusion: The complainant's suspension was disclosed by the Town. The complainant's actual salary was not disclosed by the Town. Issue C: Did section 27 of the Act apply to the complainant's personal information that he had been suspended? The Town stated that the fact that the complainant was suspended as chief of police was public knowledge. It stated that a resolution regarding the suspension was passed at an open meeting of the Police Services Board for the Town and that the local newspapers had published articles related to the suspension. Therefore, we have examined whether section 27 of the Act was applicable to the personal information disclosed in this case. Section 27 of the Act states that: This Part does not apply to personal information that is maintained for the purpose of creating a record that is available to the general public. The Town provided a copy of minutes from a meeting of the Town's Police Services Board. These minutes included the resolution that the complainant's suspension be continued indefinitely at the discretion of the Police Services Board. The Town stated that the resolution was made at an open public meeting. Section 27 states that the privacy provisions of the Act do not apply to personal information that is maintained for the purpose of creating a record that is available to the general public . While the general public may have been aware that the complainant had been suspended as chief of police, and, while that information appeared in the Police Services Board's minutes and was raised at a public meeting, the fact that the complainant had been suspended was not information that the Town was specifically maintaining \"for the purpose of creating a record available to the general public\". Accordingly, we do not consider this information to have been \"public\" within the meaning of section 27 of the Act . In our view, section 27 of the Act did not apply in the circumstances of this case. Conclusion: Section 27 of the Act was not applicable. Issue D: Was the complainant's personal information that he had been suspended disclosed",

It also asserted that, under section 315(10)(b), it has no duty to correct records of personal information that consist of a professional opinion or observation that was made in good faith.

After the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) questioned the mother\u2019s eligibility for a similar benefit over part of this time period, the mother alleged a number of privacy breaches by the service provider. Among other complaints, she alleges the service provider inappropriately shared personal information with its finance department, which applied for the federal benefit, and with the CRA.

She finds that, as joint custodial parents, the father and the mother are equally ranked substitute decision-makers for the child under the Act; and without the mother\u2019s consent to the father\u2019s request, the father cannot act as an independent substitute decision-maker to request access to the child\u2019s personal information.

The complainant also challenged the reasonableness of DCAS\u2019s search for records responsive to his request and alleged that certain DCAS staff who were addressing his correction request were in a conflict of interest. \nDCAS subsequently granted the complainant\u2019s request for two corrections. However, DCAS maintained that for the remaining five requested corrections the complainant had not demonstrated to its satisfaction that the records were inaccurate or incomplete, as required for the application of the duty to correct in section 315(9) of the Act.\nIn this decision, the adjudicator considers the correction provisions in the Act and upholds DCAS\u2019s decision that the duty to grant a correction in section 315(9) of the Act applies in respect of two of the seven requested corrections. She also concludes that DCAS has granted the two required corrections in compliance with sections 315(1) and 315(11) of the Act. Finally, the adjudicator upholds DCAS\u2019s refusal of the remaining requested corrections and the reasonableness of its search for responsive records, and she determines that the complainant\u2019s conflict of interest concern is unfounded.

The adjudicator also rejects the ministry\u2019s argument that it does not have custody or control over some records contained in the probation file.\nThe adjudicator partially upholds the ministry\u2019s claim that portions of the probation file are exempt under section 19 (solicitor-client privilege).\nThe adjudicator also partially upholds the ministry\u2019s decision to deny access under section 21(1) on the grounds of personal privacy. She finds that disclosure of some portions of the probation file would not constitute an unjustified invasion of personal privacy under section 21(2)(f) because disclosure is desirable for subjecting the activities of government agencies to public scrutiny. She further finds that there is a compelling public interest that warrants disclosure of the offender\u2019s personal information in this case.\nThe adjudicator orders the ministry to disclose a severed version of the probation file to the appellant, after removing information that is: solicitor-client privileged, properly exempted under the applicable law enforcement provisions, or that belongs to individuals other than the offender and three victims.",

    "summary": "The appellant is a union who asked the Municipality of Chatham-Kent for the names and email addresses of two employees who had forwarded to senior management a union email urging employees not to come to work on a particular day.\nThe municipality refused to give the appellant this information because it claimed that it is in labour relations or employment records that are excluded from the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act by section 52(3)3.\nIn this order, the adjudicator concludes that the emails containing the names and email addresses of the two employees are excluded from the Act by section 52(3)3.
