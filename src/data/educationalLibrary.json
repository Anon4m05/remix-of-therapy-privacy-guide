The framework recognizes that legal rules, legal procedures, and the roles of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges) produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences—whether intended or not.\n\nAs Perlin (2019) documents, TJ rapidly expanded beyond mental health law to encompass health law, contracts, family law, criminal law, and virtually the entire legal spectrum. What began as a niche academic lens has become, in Perlin's words, 'an intellectual movement' that has transformed legal scholarship and practice worldwide.\n\nTJ functions simultaneously as:\n- A **heuristic**: A practical tool for analyzing legal rules and processes\n- A **methodology**: A systematic approach to evaluating therapeutic consequences\n- A **lens**: A perspective that reveals otherwise hidden effects of legal interactions\n- A **community of scholars**: An international network advancing therapeutic approaches to law\n\nFor healthcare privacy, TJ's expansion means that every privacy provision in PHIPA, FIPPA, and MFIPPA can be examined for its therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects on patients, providers, and institutional relationships.",

Kawalek (2020) addressed this gap by developing and validating a tool for measuring TJ values during empirical research, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to confirm core behavioral scales.\n\nThe research builds on Goldberg's Canadian National Judicial Institute bench book, which identified seven core TJ values observable in legal interactions:\n\n1. **Empathy** — Understanding and acknowledging the emotional experience of others\n2. **Respect** — Treating individuals as persons with inherent dignity\n3. **Active Listening** — Fully attending to and comprehending what is communicated\n4. **Positive Focus** — Orienting toward strengths and possibilities rather than deficits\n5. **Non-Coercion** — Avoiding pressure, manipulation, or threats in decision-making\n6. **Non-Paternalism** — Supporting autonomy rather than imposing 'best interest' judgments\n7. **Clarity** — Communicating clearly, transparently, and accessibly\n\nThese same interpersonal values define therapeutic privacy interactions in healthcare. When a clinician explains privacy rights with empathy and clarity, respects patient choices without paternalism, and listens actively to privacy concerns, the legal interaction itself becomes therapeutic. Kawalek's PCA validation demonstrates that these values are not merely aspirational—they are measurable, observable, and empirically distinguishable dimensions of therapeutic interaction.",

Rather than asking only 'Is this policy evidence-based?', TJ asks: 'Does this policy produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences for those it affects?'\n\nCampbell's key insight is that health policy itself functions as an intervention that impacts health. Privacy policies in Ontario healthcare—PHIPA regulations, IPC guidance documents, institutional consent procedures—are not neutral administrative tools. They are health interventions with measurable effects on patient trust, disclosure behavior, treatment adherence, and clinical outcomes.\n\nCampbell's TJ framing questions for health policy evaluation:\n- Does this policy support or undermine the psychological well-being of those affected?\n- Are there unintended anti-therapeutic consequences that could be mitigated?\n- Could the policy achieve the same protective goals through less therapeutically harmful means?\n- Does implementation consider the lived experience of patients and providers?\n\nApplied to Ontario privacy policy, this framework transforms how we evaluate PHIPA implementation. A consent form that technically satisfies PHIPA s.29 requirements may nonetheless be anti-therapeutic if it confuses patients, creates anxiety, or reduces trust in the care relationship.",

          "content": "Wexler developed an influential metaphor distinguishing two dimensions of therapeutic jurisprudence: 'wine' and 'bottles.' As Perlin (2019) documents and Cerminara (2018) applies to health law, this framework has become central to TJ methodology.\n\n**Bottles** represent the Therapeutic Design of Law (TDL)—the legal structures, statutes, regulations, and institutional frameworks that give shape to legal interactions. In Ontario healthcare privacy, the 'bottles' include PHIPA itself, IPC orders and guidance, institutional privacy policies, and consent frameworks.\n\n**Wine** represents the Therapeutic Application of the Law (TAL)—the practices, techniques, and interpersonal styles through which legal actors implement the law. In healthcare privacy, the 'wine' includes how clinicians explain privacy rights, how consent conversations are conducted, how privacy officers handle breach responses, and how institutional culture shapes privacy practices.\n\nWexler emphasizes that the relationship between wine and bottles must be a 'seamless process'—therapeutic legal structures require therapeutic application, and vice versa. As Kawalek (2020) demonstrated empirically, the 'wine' (judicial/practitioner interaction styles) can be measured using validated scales based on the seven core TJ values.\n\nThis framework has direct implications for Ontario privacy practice:\n- **Bottle-level analysis**: Does PHIPA's design support or hinder therapeutic outcomes? Are consent provisions structured to enable genuine patient agency?\n- **Wine-level analysis**: How do clinicians actually conduct consent conversations? Do privacy practices embody empathy, respect, and clarity?\n- **Integration**: Do the bottles (legal structures) enable the wine (therapeutic practices) to flow, or do they create barriers?",

          "type": "article",
          "content": "Cerminara (2018) examined why therapeutic jurisprudence has not expanded as robustly into health law as Wexler and Winick originally anticipated, despite their belief that health law was an 'obvious' field for TJ application. Her analysis reveals critical insights for healthcare privacy.\n\n**The Patient-Centered Gap**: Health law as practiced primarily represents institutional and corporate interests—hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical companies. Patient representation is largely absent. Cerminara argues that TJ provides the perfect tool for refocusing health law on patients, adopting the patient-centered approach proposed by Hall, Schneider, and Shepherd (2006).\n\n**Four Themes for TJ Expansion in Health Law**:\n\nUsing Wexler's wine/bottles framework, Cerminara identifies four areas ripe for TJ analysis:\n\n1. **Medical-Legal Partnerships (Bottles)**: Interprofessional structures where lawyers and healthcare providers work as a team to address social determinants of health. These 'bottles' create new structures for therapeutic practice.\n\n2. **Specialized Health Courts (Bottles)**: Proposals for courts with specialized health knowledge, raising questions about procedural justice and therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects on patients.\n\n3. **Dignity (Wine)**: End-of-life care, advance directives, and the preservation of patient dignity through legal processes. Medical matters are 'quintessentially a matter of dignity, involving very personal and private facts about our bodies and our well-being.'\n\n4. **Trust (Wine)**: Hall's foundational work on trust in healthcare reveals that patients 'expect to open the most private domains of our bodies, minds, and social and family relationships' to providers. TJ analysis of how legal rules and processes build or erode this trust is essential.\n\n**Application to Ontario Healthcare Privacy**:\nCerminara's analysis validates the therapeutic privacy approach: privacy law in Ontario should be evaluated not only for its structural design (PHIPA provisions) but for its real-world impact on patient dignity, trust, and psychological well-being. Informed consent processes, for example, should be analysed for whether they genuinely build trust or merely produce signed forms.",

Each entry includes its relevance to Ontario healthcare privacy.\n\n**TJ Origins:**\n- Wexler, D.B. & Winick, B.J. (1991). Essays in Therapeutic Jurisprudence. — Foundational text defining TJ as the study of the law's role as therapeutic agent. Establishes the framework applied throughout this tool.\n- Perlin, M.L. (2019). 'Changing of the Guards: David Wexler, TJ, and the transformation of legal scholarship.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 63, 3-7. — Documents TJ's expansion from mental health law into health law, demonstrating its applicability to PHIPA and Ontario privacy practice.\n\n**TJ in Health Law:**\n- Campbell, A.T. (2010). 'TJ: A framework for evidence-informed health care policymaking.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 33, 281-292. — Reframes health policy as therapeutic intervention; directly applicable to evaluating PHIPA implementation.\n- Cerminara, K.L. (2019). 'TJ's future in health law: Bringing the patient back into the picture.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 63, 56-62. — Patient-centred health law analysis integrating end-of-life care, advance directives, and palliative care privacy.\n- Hall, M.A. (2019). 'Health law's TJ potential.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 63, 63-67. — Explores TJ's potential to transform health law from compliance framework to therapeutic tool.\n\n**TJ Measurement:**\n- Kawalek, A. (2020). 'A tool for measuring TJ values during empirical research.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 71, 101581. — Validates seven core TJ values (empathy, respect, active listening, positive focus, non-coercion, non-paternalism, clarity) through Principal Component Analysis.\n\n**TJ and Bioethics:**\n- Johnston, C. (in McKibbon, 2025). — Integrates preventive law with TJ in 'planning for the rest of life,' directly applicable to advance directives and end-of-life privacy in Ontario.\n\n**TJ and Procedural Justice:**\n- Howieson, J. (in McKibbon, 2025). — Develops the 'legal therapeutic alliance' concept—procedural justice + trust + self-determination create therapeutic legal interactions. Applicable to healthcare privacy processes.\n\n**TJ and Autonomy:**\n- Arstein-Kerslake, A. & Black, J. (2020). 'Right to legal capacity in TJ: Insights from critical disability theory and the CRPD.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 68, 101535. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Critiques TJ models that undermine autonomy through paternalistic 'best interest' reasoning. Argues for supported decision-making aligned with CRPD Article 12. Relevant to PHIPA consent frameworks.\n\n**TJ and Involuntary Treatment:**\n- Wyder, M. et al. (2015). 'The experiences of the legal processes of involuntary treatment orders: tension between the legal and medical frameworks.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 38, 44-50. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Demonstrates that involuntary treatment orders based on TJ philosophy can be experienced as either protective rights or punitive loss of agency, depending on implementation. Patients who understood the process experienced it positively; those who felt powerless experienced it as arbitrary. Directly applicable to healthcare privacy consent processes and capacity assessments.\n\n**TJ and Indigenous Communities:**\n- Ferrazzi, P. & Krupa, T. (2016). 'Symptoms of something all around us: Mental health, Inuit culture, and criminal justice in Arctic communities in Nunavut, Canada.' Social Science & Medicine, 165, 159-167. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Documents how TJ principles must be culturally contextualized, identifying pitfalls including dominance of biomedical approaches, medicalization of behaviour, paternalism in therapeutic interventions, and shortcomings in interdisciplinary collaboration. Directly relevant to privacy practices in Indigenous healthcare settings.\n\n**TJ and Healthcare Organizational Culture:**\n- Redhead, S. et al. (2025). 'Exploring women's emotional wellbeing during and after childbirth with reference to organizational regulatory processes.' J. Health Organization & Management. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Applies TJ to maternity care organizational processes, examining how institutional regulatory practices affect women's emotional wellbeing during childbirth. Demonstrates TJ's applicability to healthcare organizational processes beyond mental health.\n\n**TJ and Dignity in Public Policy:**\n- Yamada, D.C. (2019). 'On anger, shock, fear, and trauma: TJ as a response to dignity denials in public policy.' Int'l J. Law & Psychiatry, 63, 35-44. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Argues that policymaking that provokes fear, anxiety, and trauma constitutes denial of human dignity. TJ should inform both processes of policymaking and design of public policy.\n\n**TJ and End-of-Life Care:**\n- Kapp, M.B. (2013). 'The POLST paradigm: A TJ basis for legal codification.' Medical Law, 32(3), 373-88. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Proposes using TJ to evaluate advance directive laws for therapeutic effects on patients and families.\n- Kapp, M.B. (1996). 'TJ and end-of-life medical care: physician perceptions of a statute's impact.' Medical Law, 15(2), 201-17.

          "content": "Howieson (in McKibbon, 2025) develops the concept of a 'legal therapeutic alliance'—an analogue to the therapeutic alliance in clinical practice. Just as the quality of the therapist-patient relationship predicts therapeutic outcomes, the quality of legal interactions predicts whether law functions therapeutically or anti-therapeutically.\n\nThe legal therapeutic alliance rests on three pillars:\n\n**1. Procedural Justice**\nPeople experience law as therapeutic when legal processes are perceived as fair. Procedural justice requires:\n- Voice: Individuals have opportunity to be heard\n- Validation: Their concerns are acknowledged and taken seriously\n- Neutrality: Decision-makers are perceived as unbiased\n- Trustworthiness: The process is perceived as honest and transparent\n\n**2. Trust**\nTrust in legal processes develops when individuals experience consistent, fair, and transparent treatment. Trust is relational—it builds through repeated positive interactions and erodes through perceived injustice.\n\n**3. Self-Determination**\nTherapeutic legal interactions support individuals' sense of autonomy and control. Even when outcomes are unfavorable, processes that respect self-determination produce more therapeutic results.\n\n**Application to Healthcare Privacy:**\nWhen privacy processes in healthcare settings embody procedural justice (patients feel heard about their privacy concerns), build trust (consistent and transparent information governance), and support self-determination (meaningful control over health information), the privacy interaction itself becomes therapeutic. Conversely, privacy processes that feel arbitrary, opaque, or dismissive produce anti-therapeutic effects regardless of legal compliance.",

          "content": "Arstein-Kerslake and Black (in McKibbon, 2025) raise a critical challenge for therapeutic jurisprudence: traditional TJ models can inadvertently undermine autonomy when they prioritize professional decision-making over individual self-determination.\n\nTheir argument centres on Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which establishes the right to equal recognition before the law—including the right to legal capacity. This means:\n\n- **Legal capacity is a universal right**, not contingent on cognitive ability or professional assessment\n- **Supported decision-making** should replace substitute decision-making wherever possible\n- **'Best interest' reasoning** can mask paternalism—who defines 'best interest' and through whose lens?\n- **Autonomy includes the right to make decisions others disagree with**, including about privacy\n\n**Application to Ontario Healthcare Privacy:**\nPHIPA's consent framework must be examined through this lens:\n- Does capacity assessment for consent to information sharing respect legal capacity or default to substitute judgment?\n- Are patients offered supported decision-making about privacy choices, or are they simply deemed 'capable' or 'incapable'?\n- When SDMs make privacy decisions, do they follow the patient's known wishes (supported decision-making) or their own judgment of 'best interest' (substitute decision-making)?\n- Does the lockbox mechanism (PHIPA s.17) function as a tool for supported autonomy or an administrative burden that undermines it?\n\nArstein-Kerslake and Black's critique ensures that TJ in healthcare privacy genuinely empowers patients rather than replacing one form of paternalism (legal) with another (therapeutic).",
