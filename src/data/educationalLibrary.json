The framework recognizes that legal rules, legal procedures, and the roles of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges) produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences—whether intended or not.\n\nAs Perlin (2019) documents, TJ rapidly expanded beyond mental health law to encompass health law, contracts, family law, criminal law, and virtually the entire legal spectrum. What began as a niche academic lens has become, in Perlin's words, 'an intellectual movement' that has transformed legal scholarship and practice worldwide.\n\nTJ functions simultaneously as:\n- A **heuristic**: A practical tool for analyzing legal rules and processes\n- A **methodology**: A systematic approach to evaluating therapeutic consequences\n- A **lens**: A perspective that reveals otherwise hidden effects of legal interactions\n- A **community of scholars**: An international network advancing therapeutic approaches to law\n\nFor healthcare privacy, TJ's expansion means that every privacy provision in PHIPA, FIPPA, and MFIPPA can be examined for its therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects on patients, providers, and institutional relationships.",

          "type": "article",
          "content": "A persistent challenge in TJ has been the empirical measurement of therapeutic values. Kawalek (2020) addressed this gap by developing and validating a tool for measuring TJ values during empirical research, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to confirm core behavioral scales.\n\nThe research builds on Goldberg's Canadian National Judicial Institute bench book, which identified seven core TJ values observable in legal interactions:\n\n1. **Empathy** — Understanding and acknowledging the emotional experience of others\n2. **Respect** — Treating individuals as persons with inherent dignity\n3. **Active Listening** — Fully attending to and comprehending what is communicated\n4. **Positive Focus** — Orienting toward strengths and possibilities rather than deficits\n5. **Non-Coercion** — Avoiding pressure, manipulation, or threats in decision-making\n6. **Non-Paternalism** — Supporting autonomy rather than imposing 'best interest' judgments\n7. **Clarity** — Communicating clearly, transparently, and accessibly\n\n**Three Empirically Validated Scales:**\nKawalek's PCA analysis of 18 behavioral variables collapsed the theoretical values into three empirically validated scales that represent distinct dimensions of therapeutic interaction:\n\n- **Harnessing Therapeutic Support** (8 items): Encompasses empathy, compassion, understanding, personableness, hope/faith, listening, praise, motivation, and goal-reiteration. In healthcare privacy: Does the clinician demonstrate genuine care for the patient's privacy concerns and emotional state?\n\n- **Engaging Therapeutic Dialogue** (6 items): Encompasses giving voice, clear/slow speech, non-interruption, sincerity/honesty, non-pity/non-disdain, and attentiveness. In healthcare privacy: Does the clinician communicate privacy options clearly, listen without interruption, and engage sincerely with patient questions?\n\n- **Inspiring Therapeutic Change** (4 items): Encompasses asking questions, realistic goal-setting, building on strengths, and feeling positive about the future. In healthcare privacy: Does the clinician help patients understand their privacy options and feel empowered to make informed choices going forward?\n\nThese three scales are directly adaptable for evaluating how clinicians conduct privacy conversations, consent processes, and information-sharing discussions. The specificity of the 18-variable tool enables concrete measurement of therapeutic quality in healthcare interactions.\n\n**The Therapeutic Imperative:**\nKawalek frames TJ research using Stobbs' (2019) 'therapeutic imperative'—a three-pronged methodological structure:\n\n- **Command**: Identify therapeutic and anti-therapeutic aspects of legal/clinical processes (what to study and how to observe it)\n- **Duty**: If the command identifies anti-therapeutic outcomes, there is a duty to argue for modifications (absent countervailing normative considerations)\n- **Rule**: If countervailing normative considerations exist (safety, public health, legal compliance), TJ should not override those values—but should inform how they are balanced\n\nApplied to healthcare privacy: the command is to observe whether privacy practices produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects; the duty is to recommend changes when anti-therapeutic effects are found; the rule is that legal compliance requirements (PHIPA, FIPPA) remain binding, but TJ analysis reveals how to satisfy them more therapeutically.\n\n**Vols' Four-Component Research Method:**\nKawalek also describes Vols' (2019) structured approach to conducting TJ analysis, which integrates the wine/bottles framework into actionable research steps:\n\n1. Analyse the therapeutic *design* of the law (bottle-level doctrinal analysis)\n2. Analyse the therapeutic *application* of the law (wine-level empirical observation)\n3. Unravel the weight given to different interests (empirical-normative balancing)\n4. Develop research-informed law reform recommendations (normative change proposals)\n\nThis four-step methodology provides a practical roadmap for evaluating any privacy practice: examine the legal structure, observe how it's implemented, weigh competing interests, and recommend therapeutic improvements.",

          "type": "article",
          "content": "Campbell (2010) proposed therapeutic jurisprudence as a framework for evidence-informed health care policymaking, fundamentally shifting how we evaluate health policy. Rather than asking only 'Is this policy evidence-based?', TJ asks: 'Does this policy produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences for those it affects?'\n\nCampbell's key insight is that health policy itself functions as an intervention that impacts health. Privacy policies in Ontario healthcare—PHIPA regulations, IPC guidance documents, institutional consent procedures—are not neutral administrative tools. They are health interventions with measurable effects on patient trust, disclosure behavior, treatment adherence, and clinical outcomes.\n\n**Campbell's Five-Step TJ/EIHP Framework:**\nCampbell presents a specific five-step iterative process for evaluating health policy through a TJ lens:\n\n1. **Can policy address a health problem, and promote psychological well-being?** — Establish whether policy intervention is appropriate and identify therapeutic goals.\n2. **Does policymaking and/or implementation create psycho-policy soft spots?** — Identify places where the policy predictably causes psychological stress, anxiety, or harm in target populations (see below).\n3. **If policy is potentially anti-therapeutic, can we mitigate negative consequences?** — Explore redesign, implementation changes, or supportive measures.\n4. **If policy is potentially anti-therapeutic, do other (non-therapeutic) values trump?** — Recognize that therapeutic outcomes must be balanced against other legitimate policy goals (security, public health, equity).\n5. **Is no policy best (at this time)?** — Sometimes the most therapeutic option is no policy action or delayed implementation.\n\n**Psycho-Policy Soft Spots:**\nExtending Wexler's concept of 'psycholegal soft spots' (points in legal processes where psychological stress or harm predictably occurs), Campbell coined 'psycho-policy soft spots'—places where health policies predictably produce psychological distress in affected populations. For Ontario privacy policy, psycho-policy soft spots include: the anxiety produced by complex consent forms, the confusion caused by lockbox mechanisms patients don't understand, the distress when privacy processes delay access to care, and the powerlessness felt when patients discover their information has been shared without meaningful consent.\n\n**Evidence-Informed vs. Evidence-Based:**\nCampbell distinguishes three models of how evidence influences policy: (a) direct/linear use—science directly solves policy problems; (b) selective use—evidence cherry-picked to justify predetermined positions; (c) enlightenment/interactive use—evidence enriches understanding and informs iterative dialogue. The shift from evidence-*based* to evidence-*informed* policymaking recognizes that affected parties hold a preeminent position in determining and relaying information about actual psychological health consequences of policy.\n\n**Limits of TJ/EIHP:**\nCampbell explicitly acknowledges limitations: empirical uncertainty in testing TJ hypotheses, difficulty of controlled studies in policy contexts, value conflicts about what information to privilege, and the fundamental question of whether policy can be a 'healing agent' at all. TJ provides 'maximize balancing' rather than definitive answers—it is a framework for dialogue, not a formula for solutions.\n\nApplied to Ontario privacy policy, this framework transforms how we evaluate PHIPA implementation. A consent form that technically satisfies PHIPA s.29 requirements may nonetheless be anti-therapeutic if it confuses patients, creates anxiety, or reduces trust in the care relationship.",

          "content": "Wexler developed an influential metaphor distinguishing two dimensions of therapeutic jurisprudence: 'wine' and 'bottles.' As Perlin (2019) documents and Cerminara (2018) applies to health law, this framework has become central to TJ methodology.\n\n**Bottles** represent the Therapeutic Design of Law (TDL)—the legal structures, statutes, regulations, and institutional frameworks that give shape to legal interactions. In Ontario healthcare privacy, the 'bottles' include PHIPA itself, IPC orders and guidance, institutional privacy policies, and consent frameworks.\n\n**Wine** represents the Therapeutic Application of the Law (TAL)—the practices, techniques, and interpersonal styles through which legal actors implement the law. In healthcare privacy, the 'wine' includes how clinicians explain privacy rights, how consent conversations are conducted, how privacy officers handle breach responses, and how institutional culture shapes privacy practices.\n\nWexler emphasizes that the relationship between wine and bottles must be a 'seamless process'—therapeutic legal structures require therapeutic application, and vice versa. As Kawalek (2020) demonstrated empirically, the 'wine' (judicial/practitioner interaction styles) can be measured using validated scales based on the seven core TJ values.\n\nThis framework has direct implications for Ontario privacy practice:\n- **Bottle-level analysis**: Does PHIPA's design support or hinder therapeutic outcomes? Are consent provisions structured to enable genuine patient agency?\n- **Wine-level analysis**: How do clinicians actually conduct consent conversations? Do privacy practices embody empathy, respect, and clarity?\n- **Integration**: Do the bottles (legal structures) enable the wine (therapeutic practices) to flow, or do they create barriers?",

          "content": "Cerminara (2018) examined why therapeutic jurisprudence has not expanded as robustly into health law as Wexler and Winick originally anticipated, despite their belief that health law was an 'obvious' field for TJ application. Her analysis reveals critical insights for healthcare privacy.\n\n**The Patient-Centered Gap**: Health law as practiced primarily represents institutional and corporate interests—hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical companies. Patient representation is largely absent. Cerminara argues that TJ provides the perfect tool for refocusing health law on patients, adopting the patient-centered approach proposed by Hall, Schneider, and Shepherd (2006).\n\n**Four Themes for TJ Expansion in Health Law**:\n\nUsing Wexler's wine/bottles framework, Cerminara identifies four areas ripe for TJ analysis:\n\n1. **Medical-Legal Partnerships (Bottles)**: Interprofessional structures where lawyers and healthcare providers work as a team to address social determinants of health. These 'bottles' create new structures for therapeutic practice.\n\n2. **Specialized Health Courts (Bottles)**: Proposals for courts with specialized health knowledge, raising questions about procedural justice and therapeutic or anti-therapeutic effects on patients.\n\n3. **Dignity (Wine)**: End-of-life care, advance directives, and the preservation of patient dignity through legal processes. Medical matters are 'quintessentially a matter of dignity, involving very personal and private facts about our bodies and our well-being.'\n\n4. **Trust (Wine)**: Hall's foundational work on trust in healthcare reveals that patients 'expect to open the most private domains of our bodies, minds, and social and family relationships' to providers. TJ analysis of how legal rules and processes build or erode this trust is essential.\n\n**Application to Ontario Healthcare Privacy**:\nCerminara's analysis validates the therapeutic privacy approach: privacy law in Ontario should be evaluated not only for its structural design (PHIPA provisions) but for its real-world impact on patient dignity, trust, and psychological well-being. Informed consent processes, for example, should be analysed for whether they genuinely build trust or merely produce signed forms.",

          "content": "The TJ-Centered Privacy Impact Assessment (TJPIA) framework defines six design principles that should guide the creation and evaluation of privacy practices in healthcare settings. These principles move beyond compliance to intentionally design privacy practices that enhance therapeutic outcomes.\n\n**1. Contextual Flexibility**\nPrivacy practices should be adaptable to individual patient contexts, not rigid one-size-fits-all rules. Example: Allowing patients to specify who within their circle of care has access to what information, rather than blanket all-or-nothing consent.\n\n**2. Transparent Communication**\nPrivacy practices should be clearly explained in plain language, not buried in legal jargon. Example: Clinicians explaining *why* they are asking for consent and *how* information will be used, rather than simply handing patients a form to sign.\n\n**3. Patient-Centered Control**\nPatients should have meaningful agency over information governance, not symbolic participation. Example: Patients requesting that certain information not be shared with specific family members, with that request being genuinely honored and technically implemented.\n\n**4. Relationship-Based Boundaries**\nPrivacy boundaries should support therapeutic relationships, not create barriers. Example: Circle of care provisions that enable coordinated care while still respecting patient preferences about who accesses their information.\n\n**5. Therapeutic Accountability**\nWhen privacy is breached or practices fail, the response should be therapeutic (transparency, repair) not punitive (cover-up, blame). Example: Open disclosure of privacy breaches with focus on patient support and systemic learning, rather than institutional self-protection. This principle recognizes that breach response itself has therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences.\n\n**6. Dignity-Preserving Processes**\nPrivacy assessments should be conducted through compassionate conversations, not bureaucratic interrogations. Example: Assessment-as-dialogue where patients feel respected and heard, rather than assessment-as-checkbox where patients feel processed.\n\n**Assessment Flags for Anti-Therapeutic Patterns:**\nEach design principle has a corresponding assessment flag that signals when a practice has become anti-therapeutic:\n- 'Privacy used strategically to avoid transparency' (violates Transparent Communication)\n- 'Compliance without comprehension or agency' (violates Patient-Centered Control)\n- 'Privacy undermining care coordination' (violates Relationship-Based Boundaries)\n- 'Privacy used to control rather than empower' (violates Contextual Flexibility)\n- 'Privacy practices as cultural imposition' (violates Dignity-Preserving Processes)\n- 'Privacy infrastructure inhibiting care delivery' (violates all six principles)",

This causal mechanism analysis is the TJPIA's distinctive analytical contribution.\n\n**Mapping Causal Pathways:**\nFor each privacy practice, trace the chain from practice to effect:\n- Restrictive consent process → Patient feels powerless → Patient withholds information → Diagnostic gap → Worse clinical outcome\n- Privacy breach without disclosure → Patient discovers independently → Trust destroyed → Patient avoids future care → Long-term health deterioration\n- Therapeutic consent conversation → Patient feels heard and respected → Patient discloses more freely → Better clinical picture → Improved outcomes\n\n**Four Types of TJ-Specific Data Collection (TJPIA Phase 2):**\n1. **Stakeholder interviews**: Direct accounts from patients, families, clinicians, and privacy officers about how privacy practices affect their experience\n2. **Observational data**: Watch how privacy practices actually unfold in clinical settings (formal vs. actual practice gaps)\n3. **Incident analysis**: Review privacy complaints, breaches, and near-misses for therapeutic and anti-therapeutic consequences\n4. **Policy/procedure review**: Compare written privacy policies against observed practice to identify implementation gaps\n\n**Tiered Recommendation Framework (TJPIA Phase 4):**\nOnce causal mechanisms are identified, recommendations should be organized in four tiers:\n1. **Immediate fixes**: Simple changes that can be implemented now (e.g., rewriting a confusing consent form)\n2. **Policy revisions**: Changes requiring policy approval and implementation planning\n3. **Cultural shifts**: Long-term changes in institutional privacy culture (e.g., from compliance-oriented to therapeutic)\n4. **Innovative approaches**: Novel practices that fundamentally reimagine privacy interactions\n\n**Success Indicators:**\n- Therapeutic and anti-therapeutic effects clearly identified with causal mechanisms documented\n- Clinicians equipped with frameworks for therapeutic privacy decision-making\n- Patients report increased trust, agency, and psychological safety\n- Privacy seen as enabler of care, not just compliance requirement\n- Open discussion of tensions between privacy and care (not swept under rug)\n- Organizational learning from privacy incidents focused on systemic improvement",

The cultural challenge is avoiding 'terrifying your team into privacy paralysis or constantly sounding like a wet blanket of what can't be done.'\n\n**Four Fundamental Elements of Trust in Healthcare:**\n\n1. **Competence**: The environment is safe. The team have sufficient skills and capability to provide the services.\n2. **Reliability**: The team does what they say they will do. The experience is consistent.\n3. **Integrity**: The team has the best interests of clients at heart. The team and client share the same goals and values. The team operates truthfully and honestly.\n4. **Communication**: Information is proactively available. The rules are transparent, understandable and accessible. Questions are welcomed and answered.\n\n**Case Study — The Anti-Therapeutic Cost of Privacy Breach:**\nIn a 2017 Ontario prosecution, a social worker at a family health team was fined $25,000 for snooping into five clients' records. A victim stated: 'You betrayed our trust. Trust in a system to help us understand our grief, trust that our story is our own, and trust that as a mother, I promised my children a safe place for their emotions.' Justice Hampson noted: 'The victim impact statements reveal a lack of trust and a sense of reluctance to share information with future health care providers.' This case demonstrates the direct anti-therapeutic effects of privacy breaches on future help-seeking behavior.\n\n**Application to TJ:**\nThe trust builders framework directly validates Cerminara's (2018) identification of trust as one of four key themes for TJ expansion in health law. It also operationalizes Howieson's legal therapeutic alliance concept: trust, procedural justice, and self-determination create therapeutic interactions.",

Through a TJ lens, each step can be evaluated for its therapeutic or anti-therapeutic impact.\n\n**The 16 Steps:**\n1. **Identify Applicable Laws** — Legal scan every 3 years (PHIPA, FIPPA, MFIPPA, CSA Model Code, IPC guidance, regulatory College standards, accreditation, insurance)\n2. **Establish the Health Information Custodian (HIC)** — Determine who bears PHIPA liability; critical for multi-disciplinary clinics\n3. **Choose a Privacy Contact Person** — Required by PHIPA s.15; five statutory tasks (facilitate compliance, inform agents, respond to inquiries, handle access requests, receive complaints)\n4. **Survey Key Team Members** — Every 3 years, assess privacy themes, questions, and problems experienced by staff\n5. **Inventory Types of PHI** — All PHI is 'in play': you must protect it and provide access to it\n6. **Inventory Purposes for Collection/Use/Disclosure** — Document all reasons for PHI handling; don't list activities you don't actually do\n7. **Inventory Safeguards** — Three categories: administrative (policies, training), technical (passwords, encryption, audits), physical (locked spaces, shredding, sound dampening)\n8. **Write Policies** — Review annually, update every 3-4 years. Caution: 'Your policies set your standards. Do NOT make them aspirational or inspirational. Make sure they reflect your actual practices.'\n9. **Communicate** — Explain to clients, families, and the public how you handle PHI (posters, website, orientation, brochures)\n10. **Train Team Members** — Orientation for new staff plus annual refresher; IPC expects formal group training every 3-4 years\n11. **Update Vendor Contracts** — Appropriate privacy language in all contracts (IT, shredding, storage)\n12. **Conduct Compliance Audit** — Approximately every 5 years; maintain prioritized privacy improvement plan\n13. **Conduct Random Audits** — At least monthly; test for inappropriate PHI access; ensure team knows audits happen\n14. **Obtain Cyber Insurance** — Review every 3-4 years; covers first-party (notification, forensics) and third-party (privacy liability) costs\n15. **Respond to Privacy Breaches** — Use privacy breach protocol (see Just Culture framework)\n16. **Report Privacy Statistics to Board and IPC** — Since 2019, every HIC must report breach statistics annually\n\n**TJ Application:**\nSteps 4, 9, and 10 are most therapeutically significant: they emphasize communication, education, and ongoing engagement—reducing harm through understanding rather than fear. Step 8's warning against aspirational policies reflects TJ's concern with law-in-action versus law-on-the-books.",

Team members must feel safe to report errors and client safety issues\n2. Individual professionals are required to be accountable for their actions and practice ethically\n\n**Console / Coach / Punish — Three-Tier Response:**\n\n- **Human Error → Console**: Product of system design and behavioral choices. Response: change processes, procedures, training, design, environment. Therapeutic approach: acknowledge the error, support the individual, fix the system.\n- **At-Risk Behaviour → Coach**: A choice where risk was believed insignificant or justified. Response: remove incentives for risky behavior, increase situational awareness. Therapeutic approach: educate without shaming, build understanding.\n- **Reckless Behaviour → Punish**: Conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk. Response: remedial or punitive action. Therapeutic approach: even discipline should be proportionate, fair, and focused on future prevention.\n\n**Graduated Discipline Options:**\n1. Verbal warning\n2. Written warning\n3. Written reprimand\n4. Required apology\n5. Course work (remedial privacy training)\n6. Suspension from accessing electronic records\n7. Fine\n8. Suspension of employment/contract\n9. Termination of employment/contract\n\n**Evaluating Breach Gravity — Indications of Greater Gravity:**\nIntentional or reckless, nefarious purpose, actual harm, repeat offender, defiant, high number affected, highly sensitive information, received training, clearly prohibited in policy\n\n**Possible Mitigating Circumstances:**\nHonest mistake, good faith, no harm, first offence, remorse, low sensitivity, no training received, systemic issue (everyone doing it), individual unwell/requiring accommodation\n\n**Ten Privacy Breach Categories:**\n1. Snooping (unauthorized viewing)\n2. External threat (ransomware, hacking, theft)\n3. Lost/unencrypted devices or records\n4. Inappropriate sharing within team\n5. Misdirected communications\n6. Publicly viewable PHI\n7. Vendor/visitor access issues\n8. Sharing with third parties without authority\n9. Insecure disposal\n10. Covert recordings\n\n**TJ Connection:**\nThe just culture framework embodies TJ's therapeutic imperative: the command is to observe how breach response affects individuals (both patients and staff); the duty is to recommend changes when responses are anti-therapeutic; the rule is that accountability must be maintained. The emphasis on psychological safety for error reporting mirrors TJ's principle that legal processes should encourage help-seeking rather than defensiveness.

          "content": "The Health Privacy Officer Handbook (2023) provides essential practical guidance on consent, capacity, and the circle of care under PHIPA. These are areas where therapeutic implementation matters most.\n\n**The Prime Directive (PHIPA s. 30):**\n1. Do not use PHI if other information will serve the purpose\n2. Do not use more PHI than is necessary\n\n**Capacity — Not Age:**\nThere is no magic age for health information decision-making. Capacity, not age, determines who decides. The two-part capacity test asks: (1) Can the person understand the information relevant to the decision? (2) Can the person appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their choices?\n\n**Children and Minors:**\n- A capable child can make their own information decisions regardless of age\n- A capable child's objection OVERRIDES any parent's authority\n- If the child made their own treatment decisions, the parent has no automatic information rights\n- Children over 16 who are capable decide how information is shared with parents\n\n**Substitute Decision-Maker Hierarchy (PHIPA s. 26):**\n1. Guardian of person or property (with authority)\n2. Attorney for personal care or property\n3. Representative appointed by Consent and Capacity Board\n4. Spouse or partner\n5. Child or parent (or CAS/other lawful substitute)\n6. Parent with only access rights\n7. Brother or sister\n8. Any other relative\n\n**Three Types of Consent:**\n- **Express Consent**: Explicitly stated (verbal or written)\n- **Implied Consent**: Reasonably inferred from circumstances (used within circle of care)\n- **No Consent Required**: Permitted or required by law\n\n**Circle of Care:**\nSharing PHI between HICs for health care purposes relying on implied consent. Key rule (PHIPA s. 18(3)): consent must be EXPRESS (not implied) if disclosure is to a non-HIC or to another HIC but NOT for providing health care.\n\nWho is NEVER in the circle of care: police, insurance companies, employers, family members, landlords, CAS, WSIB, regulatory bodies, teachers/schools, spiritual leaders. Not being in the circle of care does NOT mean you can never share—it means you need express consent or legal authority.\n\n**Lockbox and Consent Directives:**\nPHIPA s. 37(1) and s. 38(1) give clients the right to restrict use and disclosure of their PHI. Key obligations:\n- HICs must PROACTIVELY determine a client's wishes (not wait for specific legal terminology)\n- Train team members to hear lockbox requests (patients rarely use legal language)\n- IPC Decision 213: failure to proactively determine wishes = violation of safeguarding obligations\n- If a lockbox prevents disclosure of information a custodian considers necessary, the custodian must notify the receiving provider that information has been withheld (PHIPA s. 38(2))\n\n**Activities Without Consent — Two Overarching Reasons:**\n1. Safety and protection (PHIPA s. 40: eliminating or reducing significant risk of serious bodily harm)\n2. Functioning of the health care system (data for outcomes, funding, quality improvement)\n\n**Consent vs. Notice:**\nConsent = clients choose. Notice = you inform clients what you are doing whether they can choose or not. Caution: Don't ask for consent when you don't need it—you may accidentally give clients an opt-out right you didn't intend, and don't scare clients away from seeking care.\n\n**TJ Connection:**\nThe consent framework embodies TJ at its best: the lockbox mechanism is a direct therapeutic tool giving clients control; the capable child's right to override parents honors developmental capacity; the Prime Directive prevents over-intrusion. The emphasis on proactive determination of patient wishes (IPC Decision 213) reflects TJ's principle that processes should be patient-centered, not provider-convenient.",

(in McKibbon, 2025) — Argues that policymaking that provokes fear, anxiety, and trauma constitutes denial of human dignity. TJ should inform both processes of policymaking and design of public policy.\n\n**TJ and End-of-Life Care:**\n- Kapp, M.B. (2013). 'The POLST paradigm: A TJ basis for legal codification.' Medical Law, 32(3), 373-88. (in McKibbon, 2025) — Proposes using TJ to evaluate advance directive laws for therapeutic effects on patients and families.\n- Kapp, M.B. (1996).

'Teaching Digital Privacy: Navigating the Intersection of Technology, Education, and Privacy.' International Journal of Humanities, Law and Social Sciences, IX(II). — Examines digital privacy threats (data breaches, surveillance, targeted advertising) and ethical frameworks for protecting personal information in institutional settings. While focused on education, the analysis of institutional obligations to safeguard sensitive information, consent for data collection, and the psychological impact of privacy breaches on trust is directly applicable to healthcare digital privacy challenges.\n\n**Practical Resources:**\n- Health Privacy Officer Handbook and Community (Fall 2023).

          "content": "Howieson (in McKibbon, 2025) develops the concept of a 'legal therapeutic alliance'—an analogue to the therapeutic alliance in clinical practice. Just as the quality of the therapist-patient relationship predicts therapeutic outcomes, the quality of legal interactions predicts whether law functions therapeutically or anti-therapeutically.\n\nThe legal therapeutic alliance rests on three pillars:\n\n**1. Procedural Justice**\nPeople experience law as therapeutic when legal processes are perceived as fair. Procedural justice requires:\n- Voice: Individuals have opportunity to be heard\n- Validation: Their concerns are acknowledged and taken seriously\n- Neutrality: Decision-makers are perceived as unbiased\n- Trustworthiness: The process is perceived as honest and transparent\n\n**2. Trust**\nTrust in legal processes develops when individuals experience consistent, fair, and transparent treatment. Trust is relational—it builds through repeated positive interactions and erodes through perceived injustice.\n\n**3. Self-Determination**\nTherapeutic legal interactions support individuals' sense of autonomy and control. Even when outcomes are unfavorable, processes that respect self-determination produce more therapeutic results.\n\n**Application to Healthcare Privacy:**\nWhen privacy processes in healthcare settings embody procedural justice (patients feel heard about their privacy concerns), build trust (consistent and transparent information governance), and support self-determination (meaningful control over health information), the privacy interaction itself becomes therapeutic. Conversely, privacy processes that feel arbitrary, opaque, or dismissive produce anti-therapeutic effects regardless of legal compliance.",

          "content": "Arstein-Kerslake and Black (in McKibbon, 2025) raise a critical challenge for therapeutic jurisprudence: traditional TJ models can inadvertently undermine autonomy when they prioritize professional decision-making over individual self-determination.\n\nTheir argument centres on Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which establishes the right to equal recognition before the law—including the right to legal capacity. This means:\n\n- **Legal capacity is a universal right**, not contingent on cognitive ability or professional assessment\n- **Supported decision-making** should replace substitute decision-making wherever possible\n- **'Best interest' reasoning** can mask paternalism—who defines 'best interest' and through whose lens?\n- **Autonomy includes the right to make decisions others disagree with**, including about privacy\n\n**Application to Ontario Healthcare Privacy:**\nPHIPA's consent framework must be examined through this lens:\n- Does capacity assessment for consent to information sharing respect legal capacity or default to substitute judgment?\n- Are patients offered supported decision-making about privacy choices, or are they simply deemed 'capable' or 'incapable'?\n- When SDMs make privacy decisions, do they follow the patient's known wishes (supported decision-making) or their own judgment of 'best interest' (substitute decision-making)?\n- Does the lockbox mechanism (PHIPA s.17) function as a tool for supported autonomy or an administrative burden that undermines it?\n\nArstein-Kerslake and Black's critique ensures that TJ in healthcare privacy genuinely empowers patients rather than replacing one form of paternalism (legal) with another (therapeutic).",
