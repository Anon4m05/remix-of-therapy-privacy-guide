    "description": "This assessment employs a dual-track approach recognizing that legal compliance is necessary but insufficient for therapeutic privacy practice. Track 1 evaluates whether privacy practices meet Ontario legislative requirements (PHIPA, FIPPA, MFIPPA). Track 2 evaluates whether those same practices produce therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences for patients, providers, and institutional relationships. A practice can be fully compliant yet anti-therapeutic, or therapeutically beneficial yet legally incomplete. The goal is alignment: practices that satisfy legal obligations WHILE maximizing therapeutic outcomes.",
