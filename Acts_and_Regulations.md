in subsection (2) for a further period of time of not more than 30 days if,
  (a) meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian because the information
      consists of numerous pieces of information or locating the information would necessitate a lengthy search; or
  (b) the time required to undertake the consultations necessary to reply to the request within 30 days after receiving it
      would make it not reasonably practical to reply within that time. 2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (3).

(4) Upon extending the time limit under subsection (3), the health information custodian shall give the individual written
notice of the extension setting out the length of the extension and the reason for the extension. 2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (4).

Right to complain

prescribed. 2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (11).

(4) An employee whose employment is continued under subsection (2) remains the employee of the licensee, but during the
period during which the long-term care home supervisor occupies and operates the home, the long-term care home supervisor
is solely responsible for the direction of the employee and has the rights, obligations and authority that the long-term care
home supervisor would have if the long-term care home supervisor were the employer.

respect to the portion of such a payment attributable to a period before the long-term care home supervisor began occupying
and operating the home.

to any resident, employ or contract for persons to work in the home or contract for the delivery of services to the home.
Not successor employer
(9) The making of an order under subsection 159 (5), the occupation and operation of the home by the long-term care home
supervisor or the ceasing of that occupation and operation is not a sale of a business for the purposes of section 9 of the
Employment Standards Act, 2000, section 69 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995 or section 13.1 of the Pay Equity Act.
Related employers
(10) No person is entitled to make an application under subsection 1 (4) of the Labour Relations Act, 1995 with respect to

Purposes
1 The purposes of this Act are,

      make decisions about such matters;
Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, clause 1 (b) of the Act is amended by striking out “admission to care
facilities” and substituting “admission to or confining in care facilities”. (See: 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 54 (1))
  (c) to enhance the autonomy of persons for whom treatment is proposed, persons for whom admission to a care facility is
      proposed and persons who are to receive personal assistance services by,
         (i) allowing those who have been found to be incapable to apply to a tribunal for a review of the finding,
        (ii) allowing incapable persons to request that a representative of their choice be appointed by the tribunal for the
             purpose of making decisions on their behalf concerning treatment, admission to a care facility or personal
             assistance services, and
        (iii) requiring that wishes with respect to treatment, admission to a care facility or personal assistance services,
              expressed by persons while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, be adhered to;

             purpose of making decisions on their behalf concerning treatment, admission to or confining in a care facility or
             personal assistance services, and
        (iii) requiring that wishes with respect to treatment, admission to or confining in a care facility or personal assistance
              services, expressed by persons while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, be adhered to;
  (d) to promote communication and understanding between health practitioners and their patients or clients;
  (e) to ensure a significant role for supportive family members when a person lacks the capacity to make a decision about a
      treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service; and
   (f) to permit intervention by the Public Guardian and Trustee only as a last resort in decisions on behalf of incapable
       persons concerning treatment, admission to a care facility or personal assistance services. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 1.
Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, clauses (e) and (f) of the Act are repealed and the following substituted:
(See: 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 54 (2))

Same

Principles for giving or refusing consent

do so in accordance with the following principles:
   1. If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and
      after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall give or refuse consent in accordance with the wish.
   2. If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while
      capable and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the
      incapable person’s best interests. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 42 (1).
Best interests
(2) In deciding what the incapable person’s best interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent on his or her behalf
shall take into consideration,
  (a) the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable person held when capable and believes he or she would still
      act on if capable;
  (b) any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to admission to a care facility that are not required to be
      followed under paragraph 1 of subsection (1); and
  (c) the following factors:
         1. Whether admission to the care facility is likely to,
                 i. improve the quality of the incapable person’s life,
                 ii. prevent the quality of the incapable person’s life from deteriorating, or
               iii. reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to
                    deteriorate.
         2. Whether the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without
            admission to the care facility.
         3. Whether the benefit the incapable person is expected to obtain from admission to the care facility outweighs the
            risk of negative consequences to him or her.
         4. Whether a course of action that is less restrictive than admission to the care facility is available and is appropriate
            in the circumstances. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 42 (2).

      Sched. A, s. 47 (1); 2022, c. 16, s. 9 (1).
Consent or refusal to be obtained
(2) When an admission to a care facility is authorized under subsection (1), the person responsible for authorizing
admissions to the care facility shall obtain consent, or refusal of consent, from the incapable person’s substitute decision-
maker promptly after the person’s admission. 2007, c. 8, s. 207 (9).
Exception
(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to an authorization by a placement co-ordinator of an ALC patient’s admission to a
long-term care home in accordance with section 60.1 of the Fixing Long-Term Care Act, 2021. 2022, c. 16, s. 9 (2).
Distinct from ALC patient admission
(4) For greater certainty, an admission of an ALC patient to a long-term care home under section 60.1 of the Fixing Long-
Term Care Act, 2021 is distinct from, and does not preclude, an admission to a care facility under this section. 2022, c. 16, s.
9 (2).

admission. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 48 (2).

it is not reasonable to do so in the circumstances. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 48 (4).
Person making decision on another’s behalf
49 A person who gives or refuses consent on another person’s behalf to his or her admission to a care facility, acting in good
faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 49.

Principles for giving or refusing consent
54.7 (1) A person who gives or refuses consent on an incapable person’s behalf to his or her confining in a care facility shall
do so in accordance with the following principles:
   1. If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and
      after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall give or refuse consent in accordance with the wish.
   2. If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while
      capable and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the
      incapable person’s best interests. 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 60.
Best interests
(2) In deciding what the incapable person’s best interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent on the incapable
person’s behalf shall take into consideration,
  (a) the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable person held when capable and believes that the incapable
      person would still act on if capable;
  (b) any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to confining in a care facility that are not required to be
      followed under paragraph 1 of subsection (1); and
  (c) the following factors:
         (i) whether confining in the care facility is likely to,
               (A) improve the quality of the incapable person’s life,
               (B) prevent the quality of the incapable person’s life from deteriorating, or
               (C) reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to
                   deteriorate,
        (ii) whether the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without
             confining in the care facility,
       (iii) whether the benefit the incapable person is expected to obtain from confining in the care facility outweighs the
             risk of negative consequences to the incapable person,
        (iv) whether a course of action that is less restrictive than confining in the care facility is available and is appropriate
             in the circumstances. 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 60.
Confining
(3) Subject to paragraph 1 of subsection (1), the person shall not give consent on the incapable person’s behalf to the
incapable person’s confining in a care facility, unless the confining is essential to prevent serious bodily harm to the
incapable person or to others, or allows the incapable person greater freedom or enjoyment. 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 60.



                                                                30

Application of Part

Meaning of “substitute decision-maker”
56 In this Part,

  assistance service on behalf of a recipient who is incapable with respect to the service. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 56.
                                           DECISION ON INCAPABLE RECIPIENT’S BEHALF
Decision on incapable recipient’s behalf
57 (1) If a recipient is found by an evaluator to be incapable with respect to a personal assistance service, a decision
concerning the service may be made on the recipient’s behalf by his or her substitute decision-maker in accordance with this
Act. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 57 (1).
Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, subsection 57 (1) of the Act is repealed and the following substituted:
(See: 2017, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 61)
Decision on incapable recipient’s behalf
(1) If a recipient is found by an evaluator to be incapable with respect to a personal assistance service,
  (a) a decision concerning the service may be made on the recipient’s behalf by the recipient’s substitute decision-maker in
      accordance with this Act; and

Determining who may make decision
58 For the purpose of determining who is authorized to make a decision concerning a personal assistance service on behalf of
a recipient who is incapable with respect to the service,
  (a) section 20, except subsections 20 (5) and (6), applies with necessary modifications;
  (b) if no person described in subsection 20 (1) meets the requirements of subsection 20 (2), the Public Guardian and
      Trustee may make the decision concerning the personal assistance service; and
  (c) if two or more persons who are described in the same paragraph of subsection 20 (1) and who meet the requirements
      of subsection 20 (2) disagree about the decision to be made concerning the personal assistance service, and if their
      claims rank ahead of all others, the Public Guardian and Trustee may make the decision in their stead. 1996, c. 2,
      Sched. A, s. 58.
Principles for making decision
59 (1) A person who makes a decision on an incapable recipient’s behalf concerning a personal assistance service shall do so
in accordance with the following principles:




                                                                   38
   1. If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the recipient expressed while capable and after
      attaining 16 years of age, the person shall make the decision in accordance with the wish.
   2. If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the recipient expressed while capable and
      after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the recipient’s best
      interests. 1996, c. 2, Sched. A, s. 59 (1).
Best interests
(2) In deciding what the recipient’s best interests are, the person shall take into consideration,
  (a) the values and beliefs that the person knows the recipient held when capable and believes he or she would still act on if
      capable;
  (b) any wishes expressed by the recipient with respect to the personal assistance service that are not required to be
