Keywords:                                                 Translation of evidence-based practice (EBP) into health care policy is of growing importance, with
Therapeutic jurisprudence                                 discussions most often focused on how to fund and otherwise promote EBP through policy (i.e., at system
Evidence-based health policy                              level, beyond the bedside). Less attention has been focused on how to ensure that such policies — as enacted
                                                          and implemented, and as distinguished from the practices underlying policies — do not themselves cause
                                                          harm, or at least frustrate accomplishment of “therapeutic” goals of EBP. On a different front, principles of
                                                          therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) in law have been developed, most prominently in certain areas of law (e.g.,
                                                          mental health and family law), to support more collaborative, less traumatic advocacy and conﬂict resolution.
                                                          This paper draws on current applications of TJ and translates such into a therapeutic approach to health care
                                                          policymaking that moves beyond promotion of EBP in policy. Health care policy itself may be viewed as an
                                                          intervention that impacts health, positively or not. The goal is to offer a framework for health care
                                                          policymaking grounded in TJ principles that does not focus on which evidence is “right” for policy use, but
                                                          rather how we can better understand how consequences of policy, intended or not, affect the well-being of
                                                          populations. Such framework thus moves policymaking from an either/or debate to a data- and human-driven
                                                          process. Utilizing TJ framing questions, policies can be developed and evaluated through open dialogue among
                                                          diverse voices at the table, including — like interventions — the “patients” or, here, targets of such policies.
                                                          Collectively, they clarify how ends sought — to enhance (or at least not impair) health — can best be achieved
                                                          through policy when needed, recognizing that as an intervention, there are limits to and boundaries on the
                                                          usefulness of policy.
