Professionals' perceptions of the Saskatoon Mental Health Strategy (MHS) Court:
a qualitative analysis.

The Saskatoon Mental Health Strategy (MHS) aims to improve supervision for justice-
involved individuals with mental illness and cognitive impairments. Given the limited
research on certain aspects of mental health courts, the current study seeks to add to
this growing body of literature by exploring professionals' perceptions of the Saskatoon
MHS Court. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of nine
professionals involved in the Saskatoon MHS Court, and results were divided into three
main themes (balancing priorities and viewpoints, resources, and connections) with
corresponding subthemes. Despite challenges, professionals thought that the Court was
meeting its goals by treating the underlying causes of offending behaviour rather than
simply criminalizing the behaviours. Suggestions for improving the overall effectiveness
and functioning of the Court are discussed.

Protecting emotional wellbeing during childbirth: exploring the role of
organisational regulatory processes in promoting compassion.

Redhead CAB

Frontiers in Global Womens Health. 6:1569334, 2025.

[Journal Article]

UI: 40145023

In this article I consider how legal processes have power to facilitate or impede
emotional safety and wellbeing for women and birthing people. I suggest that the use of
therapeutic jurisprudence to re-view NHS Foundation Trusts' organisational and
     regulatory processes can offer new insights. Therapeutic jurisprudence is an approach
     which pays purposeful attention to the therapeutic (or harmful) consequences of legal
     processes and how they impact the psychological well-being of those upon whom they
     act. The report of the Inquiry into maternity and neonatal services at East Kent Hospitals
     University NHS Foundation Trust was the catalyst for the theoretical suggestions I make
     in this article. In its response to this report, the Government has acknowledged the
     importance of a culture of honesty, compassion and safety. However, none of the
     Government's recommendations considers the impact of organisational regulatory
     processes on the provision of compassionate care. My argument here is that such
     processes are neither inert nor benign. Critical socio-legal literature provides clear
     evidence of the anti-therapeutic potential of hierarchical organisational structures, and
     this is con rmed by the ndings of the East Kent Report. Presenting a brief, therapeutic
     jurisprudence-informed review of some of the ndings of the East Kent report, I suggest
     that a re-view of NHS Trusts' constitution and governance processes might offer the new
     means of tackling maternity service failures for which Bill Kirkup called in the East Kent
     Report, with the ultimate aim of ensuring emotional safety and wellbeing for pregnant
     and birthing people in childbirth.

     Hoarding disorder, therapeutic jurisprudence and residential tenancy law: A
     complex relationship and opportunities for reform. [Review]

     For many, home represents comfort and security. However, for renters living with
     hoarding disorder, stable housing is often at risk. Hoarding disorder is a chronic mental
     illness associated with signi cant public health risks to both communities and individuals
     across jurisdictions. Internationally, residential tenancy laws often address hoarding
     using blunt legal measures at odds with the treatment needs of people living with the
     condition, which can negatively impact their health and wellbeing and potential recovery.
     Leveraging a therapeutic jurisprudence framework to consider biopsychosocial
     outcomes, this paper examines residential tenancy laws in Victoria, Australia to consider
     how tenancy laws affect tenure security and the extent to which they hinder the
     promotion of health and wellbeing among renters living with hoarding disorder. A rapid
     review of international academic and grey literature, Victorian case-law and relevant
     parts of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (Vic) was conducted. Analysis showed that,
     in the case of Victoria, the legal framework does not fully align with therapeutic
     jurisprudence principles, instead relying on impersonal task-centred approaches to
     address hoarding related issues in rental properties. Consequently, renters living with
     hoarding disorder are at increased risk of psychological distress, homelessness, and a



                                                                                        Page 2

reluctance to engage with supports. Recommendations with international relevance and
applicability are discussed, including sector coordination and capacity building, and
common avenues for legislative reform. Future research should prioritise lived
experience perspectives, along with generating improved evidence through robust data
collection that can inform reform in the rental sector.

Between epistemic injustice and therapeutic jurisprudence: Coronial processes
involving families of autistic people, people with learning disabilities and/or
mental ill health.

Sociology of Health & Illness. 47(2):e13855, 2025 Feb.

[Journal Article]

UI: 39555897

Understanding how and why someone dies unexpectedly is key to bereaved family
members. The coronial process in England investigates instances where the cause of
death is unknown, violent or unnatural and/or occurred in state detention. Families are
held to be at the centre of this process and the coroner's role has extended to concern
about therapeutic jurisprudence, that is, how legal processes can minimise negative
consequences for participants without jeopardising due process. Therapeutic
jurisprudence involves unresolved tensions, however, and an epistemic power
imbalance. Within the inquest, knowledge is produced, evaluated and contested, and
epistemic privilege may be unevenly distributed. The inquest is also a process that, as
we demonstrate, requires epistemic courage and resistance on the part of families.
Families with relatives who are autistic, have learning disabilities and/or mental ill health
can experience epistemic and structural injustice before an unexpected death which
makes the distinctiveness of their experiences important to understand. Here, we report
on a qualitative interview project which focused on how bereaved families experience
the coronial process after their relative died in receipt of health and/or social care
support.

Cardinal Principles to Consider: The Rationale for Implementing Therapeutic
Jurisprudence with Youth Manifesting Sexually Abusive Behaviors.

This article brings attention to cardinal principles to consider when implementing the
Therapeutic Jurisprudence multidisciplinary approach with youth who are manifesting
sustained coarse sexual improprieties and come to the attention of the judicial system.
The obstacles of implementing therapeutic jurisprudence with this population include the
persistent reliance of researchers on adult paradigms for risk assessment tools, along
with treatment models that are not developmentally and gender sensitive, nor empirically
supported for youth. Adherence to the scienti c method is essential when constructing
risk assessment tools that meet forensic standards. Applying the rich collateral paradigm
of therapeutic jurisprudence within the context of valid and reliable measurements of
intervention outcomes would immensely bene t those youth entangled with judicial
systems who repeatedly are victims of abuse (neglect, maltreatment, physical and/or
sexual). Youth who become entangled with the judicial system as dependents, and/or
suspected or charged with criminal activity, need additional collateral resources geared
toward ongoing developmental needs and speci c to gender. Practical considerations
and recommendations are made in contemplating expanding Therapeutic Jurisprudence
with youth who engage in sustained sexually harmful behaviors to self and others.

Implementing a Recovery Capital Model Into Therapeutic Courts: Case Study and
Lessons Learned.

Recovery capital is a strengths-based and multi-level model for examining the process
and outputs of recovery and desistance. Recovery capital posits that the more positive
resources one accrues, the better the chances of recovery. Oftentimes growth of one's
recovery capital must be initiated through identifying programs in the community to
create supportive scaffolding: this may be especially true for individuals involved in the
justice system who may experience additional barriers to accessing programming. This
manuscript presents the results of a pilot evaluation of the REC-CAP, a recovery-capital
oriented system of measurement, planning, and engagement in two drug treatment
courts. We include a description of the implementation process and results from surveys
and focus groups with the court staff. Results suggests that the trainings were useful and
that court staff meaningfully engaged with the REC-CAP system. Court staff felt the
REC-CAP provided important information about court clients' strengths and barriers and

A framework for the evidence-based practice of therapeutic jurisprudence: A legal
therapeutic alliance.

Howieson JA

International Journal of Law & Psychiatry. 89:101906, 2023 Jul-Aug.

[Journal Article]

UI: 37451069

This paper provides a theoretical rationale for using the constructs of procedural justice,
trust and self-determination as a framework to guide the evidence-based practice of
therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ). The overarching purpose of TJ is to provide therapeutic
outcomes to all participants in the legal system. This paper proposes that in legal
decision-making, running a procedurally just process that generates trust amongst
participants and allows the parties to experience self-determination, creates a dynamic
akin to the therapeutic alliance, which, in therapy, is a reliable predictor of therapeutic
outcomes. The paper argues that when a legal therapeutic alliance forms in a legal
decision-making process then positive therapeutic outcomes are possible, and the
process can be classi ed as one that accords with the philosophy of TJ. A subsequent
argument is that a therapeutic court can be de ned as one that enacts such a process.

     A Revised Approach to Advance Personal Planning: The Role of Theory in
     Achieving "The Good Result".

     This article explores traditional views of advance care planning in the broader context of
     advance personal planning, which also accounts for legal and nancial matters.
     Criticisms of existing processes are noted, while the signi cance of interprofessional
     collaboration is highlighted. Reframing the purpose of advance personal planning as
     planning for the rest of life, rather than the end-of-life, and adopting a more holistic
     perspective informed by theory may help individuals to view advance personal planning
     as a routine, preventative exercise that safeguards their autonomy and well-being. Both
     lawyers and healthcare providers have an important role to play in reframing the purpose
     of advance personal planning. This revised approach is underpinned by the uni cation of
     two separate theoretical lenses: Preventive Law Theory and Therapeutic Jurisprudence.
     This combination enhances our understanding of what it means for people to truly
     achieve "the good result" (Holtz 2017) when planning ahead for their future legal,
      nancial, health, and personal interests. Preventive Law Theory encourages an ongoing,
     collaborative relationship between lawyers and their clients, or healthcare providers and
     their patients, while Therapeutic Jurisprudence ensures an ethical approach to advance
     personal planning that accounts for all aspects of the individual's well-being, including
     consideration of vulnerability, autonomy, and empowerment.

          This paper discusses in theoretical and practical terms how the Desistance Paradigm
          offers a powerful and underexplored potential alliance with Therapeutic Jurisprudence,
          especially regarding the social reintegration of those who break the law. As such, this
          paper presents a description of the Therapeutic Justice and Desistance Paradigm, along
          with their main ndings and theoretical scope, to then present a discussion of how these
          two approaches share a common horizon (which are not only limited to practices and
          techniques, but also to legal structures and procedures). Finally, it concludes with some
          future challenges for which the convergence of these two paradigms can offer fruitful
          developments within the criminal justice system.

          Consistent with a therapeutic jurisprudence framework, court decisions and processes
          can have a therapeutic or antitherapeutic effect on intimate partner violence (IPV)
          victims. To maximize therapeutic effects, IPV scholars have advocated for survivor-
          de ned practices that emphasize the importance of engaging with victims in a
          collaborative manner that promotes autonomy, choice, and control. However, limited
          research exists in the context of criminal protection orders (POs). The current study
          addressed this gap by assessing whether criminal PO match (whether victims received
          the level PO they requested [i.e., PO match] or not [i.e., PO mismatch]) and victims'
          subjective experiences of the court process were associated with their willingness to use
          the system in the future to address IPV. In a sample of 187 women whose partners were
          arrested for IPV, experiencing the court processes as positive (beta = .36, p = .001) and
          court-related fear (beta = .41, p < .001) were positively associated with willingness to
          use the system in the future. Additionally, PO match moderated the association between

          subjective court experiences and willingness to use the system in the future.
          Experiencing the court processes as negative (b = .33, p = .005) and validating (b = -.36,
          p = .001) was associated with willingness to use the system in the future only for
          participants who did not receive the PO level they requested. While experiencing the
          court as positive (b = -.40, p <= .001) was associated with willingness to use the system
          regardless of PO match, it was most strongly associated for participants who did not
          receive the PO level they requested. Results suggest the importance of ascertaining
          strategies to improve victims' experiences with the court, especially when victims'
          requests are not met, to increase future engagement with the system.

          Problem-solving courts were created as a means of therapeutic jurisprudence. They
          arose in the context of the post-deinstitutionalization in ux of defendants with behavioral
          and social problems entering the criminal court system. Seeing that typical judicial
          practices were poor solutions for individuals primarily facing problems such as
          homelessness, substance use disorders, and mental illness, courts developed
          specialized dockets as a solution to the problem of not being able to restrict the ow of
          these individuals into courtrooms. Although highly regarde, mental health courts (MHCs)
          and drug courts (DCs) can harm people with mental illness and addiction and contribute
          to the oppression of disenfranchised populations, including racial and ethnic minorities.
          By tying access to needed treatment to criminal justice system involvement, MHCs and
          DCs can increase criminalization of mental illness, subject individuals to long-term
          collateral consequences, and interfere with social policy reforms that would dismantle
          the prison-industrial complex (PIC). As forensic mental health professionals, we must
          re ect on our practices and consider the impact that our professional decisions have on
          the patients that we serve, and on society as a whole, and advocate for criminal justice
          and healthcare system reforms that truly free individuals in need of mental health or
          substance use treatment from the grasp of the PIC.

A patchwork of drug courts and other problem-solving courts currently exists to divert
individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders away from the criminal
justice system. We call for a broader implementation of problem-solving courts,
particularly at the federal level, that would operate according to the principles of
therapeutic jurisprudence (i.e., a framework that aims to maximize the health bene ts of
judicial and legislative policies and practices). Expanding federal problem-solving courts
will better serve individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders in the
federal criminal justice system and allow them to bene t from rehabilitation and diversion
programs. This effort will also signal that the federal judiciary has recognized the criminal
justice system's failure to address inmate mental health care, and that it is willing to
institute changes to provide appropriate, evidence-based interventions.

This article addresses whether autonomy is being adequately protected within
therapeutic jurisprudence models. It rst outlines the history and theory of therapeutic
jurisprudence - noting that protection for autonomy has been theorised as a key
component of therapeutic jurisprudence. It then examines therapeutic jurisprudence in
light of critical disability theory and identi es that traditional therapeutic models, which
often prioritises the decision-making of professionals, can undermine the autonomy of
the individual. The article then describes the protection for autonomy provided by the
right to legal capacity in Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities. An analysis is undertaken of practical examples of where therapeutic
jurisprudence falls short of the demands of Article 12. Finally, the article presents
solutions for how therapeutic jurisprudence models could better protect autonomy via
respect for the right to legal capacity in Article 12.

     Since its inception in the 1980s, the growing body of Therapeutic Jurisprudence
     scholarship has continued to challenge and optimise not only our understanding of what
     the law "is", but also how we can leverage its agency to improve the ways in which we
     apply, observe and evaluate the law. By focusing on the emotional, human and
     psychological consequences of legal processes, Therapeutic Jurisprudence empowers
     practitioners to design emotionally intelligent and remedial strategies to either minimise
     harmful consequences or enhance restorative legal goals and outcomes. As the
     in uence of Therapeutic Jurisprudence scholarship and its practical applications has
     continued to gain traction in rapid and organic growth, collaborations brokered with a
     wide range of social science disciplines have called for a more robust focus on validated
     measurement scales. To that end, there is a clear and growing need for a suite of
     Therapeutic Jurisprudence speci c tools for empirical evaluation. As there has been no
     formal attempt within the Therapeutic Jurisprudence research community to begin this
     process, this paper breaks new ground by providing a validated tool for empirical
     measurement of the therapeutic quality of judicial of cers' behavioural and interactional
     styles in problem-solving court jurisdictions. Using original empirical data recently
     collected at a problem-solving court in England, the paper takes the reader through the
     journey of statistically validating the levied scaling systems by performing Principal
     Component Analysis and Cronbach's Alpha. In doing so, the paper offers an original
     contribution to Therapeutic Jurisprudence methodology.

     The Israel Family Court - Therapeutic jurisprudence and jurisprudential therapy
     from the start.

     Based on the recommendations of a commission set up to review the handling of Family
     Law cases in Israel, the Family Courts Law 5755-1995 included a revolutionary provision
     - that a Social Services Unit, staffed by senior social workers, would be an integral part
     of each Family Court. Their mandate includes giving assessment, advice and assistance
     services to litigants and to the court, and this provision has been broadly interpreted, to
     include mediation and referrals for therapy. The activities of the Unit are con dential and
     free of charge to the parties. More recently the Units were given the task of seeing
     children whose future is the subject of litigation, to nd out their needs and views; and
     also to serve as the agency which parties who want to start proceedings are required to
     attend, in order to receive information about the effect of proceedings on their children
     and advice about alternative dispute resolution to avoid litigation. The resulting synergy
     between the social workers and the Judges ensures that the needs of all those involved
     are met in a therapeutic fashion where this is necessary and possible, alongside the
     judicial powers to make orders as needed. Thus unnecessary suffering can be mitigated.

     The legal systems and the judiciary in many countries have been changed and
     reformed, with the aim of dispensing justice quicker and more effectively. Some reforms
     have tried a less adversarial approach to resolving legal disputes, for example,
     Therapeutic Jurisprudence (TJ) and Restorative Justice (RJ). The objective of this article
     is to describe how institutionalized these movements are in the United States and the
     roles played by judges in this process. The data collection involved document analysis,
     observation of court-hearings, and interviews with 13 judges from several judicial areas
     involved in TJ and/or RJ judicial proceedings in the United States. Data analysis was
     undertaken using content analysis and the software NVivo. The results provide evidence
     that (a) these movements are in a process of divergent change implementation; (b)
     judges who engage with these approaches act as institutional entrepreneurs; and (c) the
     judges interviewed can be classi ed into four roles that are complementary in the
     promotion of TJ/RJ: promoter, author, convener, and maintainer.

     It is generally recognized that persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities
     (IDD) are at greater risk than the general population when they encounter the criminal
     justice system due to vulnerabilities such as cognition, memory and language (Jones,
     2007). To date, little evidence has been generated regarding best practice to support
     persons with IDD in the criminal justice system, speci cally the courtroom. Various
     models of problem-solving courts have developed across Canada to divert cases
     composed of complex human social problems to more appropriate community-based
     treatment and supports. Past Canadian authors have raised critical questions that
     require re ection about the broader theory of Therapeutic Jurisprudence (TJ) and its
     current implementation in problem-solving courts. Given the risk and vulnerabilities of
     persons with IDD in the criminal justice system, problem-solving courts (speci cally
     mental health courts) hold great promise to address some of the unique needs of these

     On anger, shock, fear, and trauma: therapeutic jurisprudence as a response to

     This article asserts that when policymaking processes, outcomes, and implementations
     stoke fear, anxiety, and trauma, they often lead to denials of human dignity. It cited as
     prime examples the recent actions of America's current federal government concerning
     immigration and health care. As a response, I urge that therapeutic jurisprudence should
     inform both the processes of policymaking and the design of public policy, trained on
     whether human dignity, psychological health, and well-being are advanced or
     diminished. I also discuss three methodologies that will help to guide those who want to
     engage legislation in a TJ-informed manner. Although achieving this fundamental shift
     will not be easy, we have the raw analytical and intellectual tools to move wisely in this
     direction.

     Although therapeutic jurisprudence ("TJ") is increasingly well-established internationally,
     particularly within the United States of America ("US"), to date it remains relatively
     unacknowledged within the United Kingdom ("UK"). This article will explore the
     opportunities presented within contemporary UK society for the greater promotion, and
     eventual mainstreaming, of TJ. It will also consider the challenges faced during this
     process and how best to overcome these. Its rst key area of focus will be upon the
     potential role of legal education in the UK in educating law students (and academics)
     about TJ, considering which approaches are likely to be most effective in incorporating
     TJ perspectives, at what stage this should occur and to what extent TJ is likely to impact
     on the existing curricula at a time when proposed changes relating to entry into the legal
     profession are heavily in uencing the work of Law Schools. The article will then move on
     to consider the receptiveness of the UK legal profession to the TJ paradigm in light of
     recent attempts to move to a competency-based approach to practice and to
     reconceptualise professionalism to meet the challenges of increasing fragmentation and
     corporatisation. The third key area it will explore is the UK's recent plans to reintroduce
     problem-solving courts ("PSCs") into its criminal justice system. The authors will discuss
     the downfall of the six UK Drug Court ("DC") pilots originally established in 2005
     theorising upon their failures and re ecting upon whether the current UK criminal justice
     system is truly able to support a fresh round of PSC initiatives. The article will end with
     recommendations for ways in which the international TJ community should begin the
     process of mainstreaming TJ within the UK. It will conclude that there are currently
     signi cant opportunities to be utilised, but that this requires signi cant commitment and
     mobilisation amongst existing TJ scholars and practitioners.

     More than 25years ago, Professors David Wexler and Bruce Winick envisioned broad
     application of therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ), an interdisciplinary theory of law
     suggesting that legislatures, regulators, and judges consider the extent to which their
     decisions impact the psychological well-being of those upon whom the law acts. TJ most
     obviously plays a signi cant role in mental health and criminal law, where it originated,
     but Wexler and Winick long ago opined that TJ could be useful in a wide variety of other
     disciplines as well. Indeed, TJ has expanded exponentially in application over the years.
     Yet, although Wexler and Winick originally suggested that health law was an "obvious"
      eld in which it could expand, application of TJ in that discipline has been less robust
     than one might have expected. This article will examine the extent to which TJ has been
     applied in health law other than mental health law, categorize the areas of health law in
     which it has been applied, and suggest future paths for expansive application in this
     most obvious of areas.

The law and legal processes can affect the psychological and emotional well-being of
the people involved. Individuals who are already traumatized can experience stress
which triggers prior trauma through court policies, practices, and environment during
involvement with the child abuse and neglect court system. However, some courts use
trauma-informed policies, practices, and environments which are based on the notion of
therapeutic jurisprudence. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if dependency
court personnel in larger jurisdictions have differing understandings of trauma, and
differing perceptions of court policies, practices, and environment than their counterparts
from smaller jurisdictions. Results indicate that smaller jurisdiction personnel have a
higher understanding of trauma, as well as perceive themselves to be more trauma-
informed in the areas of policy, practice, and environment when compared to larger
jurisdiction personnel. Implications are discussed and recommendations from a
therapeutic jurisprudence framework are suggested.

          RATIONALE: Rehabilitation-oriented criminal court mental health initiatives to reduce the
          number of people with mental illness caught in the criminal justice system exist in many
          North American cities and elsewhere but not in the mainly Inuit Canadian Arctic territory
          of Nunavut.
            OBJECTIVE: This study explores whether the therapeutic aims of these resource-
          intensive, mainly urban initiatives can be achieved in criminal courts in Nunavut's
          resource constrained, culturally distinct and geographically remote communities.
            METHOD: A qualitative multiple-case study in the communities of Iqaluit, Arviat and
          Qikiqtarjuaq involved 55 semi-structured interviews and three focus groups with
          participants representing four sectors essential to these initiatives: justice, health,
          community organizations and community members. These interviews explored whether
          the therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) principles that guide criminal court mental health
          initiatives and the component objectives of these principles could be used to improve the
          criminal court response to people with mental illness in Nunavut.
            RESULTS: Interviews revealed 13 themes re ecting perceptions of Inuit culture's
          in uence on the identi cation of people with mental illness, treatment, and collaboration
          between the court and others. These themes include cultural differences in de ning
          mental illness, differences in traditional and contemporary treatment models, and the
          importance of mutual cultural respect.
            CONCLUSION: The ndings suggest Inuit culture, including its recent history of
          cultural disruption and change, affects the vulnerability of Nunavut communities to the
          potential moral and legal pitfalls associated with TJ and criminal court mental health
          initiatives. These pitfalls include the dominance of biomedical approaches when
          identifying a target population, the medicalization of behaviour and culture, the risk of
          "paternalism" in therapeutic interventions, and shortcomings in interdisciplinary
          collaboration that limit considerations of Inuit culture. The pitfalls are not fatal to efforts to
          bring the rehabilitative bene ts of these initiatives to Nunavut, but they require careful
          vigilance when employing TJ principles in an Indigenous circumpolar context.

Legal scholarship relevant to criminal court mental health initiatives that divert people
with mental illness from prosecution to treatment has created the concept of therapeutic
jurisprudence (TJ), an approach that seeks to maximize the law's potential for
therapeutic outcomes. Despite recognition that TJ includes a rehabilitative response as a
key animating principle and that it advocates for interdisciplinary synthesis, TJ has
developed mainly from within the practice and discipline of law and without reference to
the discipline of rehabilitation science, in which approaches to mental health
rehabilitation (MHR) have witnessed signi cant developments in recent decades. In
particular, concepts of MHR have shifted from a biomedical focus to a psychosocial
approach, such as the recovery model, that incorporates values of self-determination,
independence, and empowerment. It is argued that greater consideration of MHR will
improve the theoretical validity of TJ by 1) helping de ne what 'therapeutic' means; 2)
constructing a normative framework; and 3) broadening the scope of TJ as an
interdisciplinary approach. More research is needed to ensure concepts from MHR
rehabilitation science are considered in TJ legal scholarship and criminal court mental
health initiatives.

Mental health courts represent a key component of contemporary responses to mental
illness and disability in the criminal justice system, and yet there is uncertainty about
how these courts should balance their punishment and treatment roles. This paper
reports an analysis of interviews with court professionals which considers their
understanding of the rationale underpinning an Australian mental health court, its
effectiveness in achieving its criminal justice and clinical goals, and of broader notions of
therapeutic jurisprudence. This reveals considerable support for diversionary mental
health court programs of this type and professional con dence that this type of program
is effective. However, the analysis also highlights con ict in the practice frameworks of
the different professional groups who regularly contribute to the operations of the court.
Suggestions to enhance service delivery are offered.

The experiences of the legal processes of involuntary treatment orders: tension

UI: 25804786

3An involuntary treatment order (ITO) allows a person to be treated for a mental illness
without consent under some circumstances. While the treatment and assessment of
mental illness are essentially clinical decisions, involuntary mental health admissions are
governed by a framework of legal principles, safeguards and procedures. The underlying
philosophy of these laws is based on therapeutic jurisprudence. This approach focuses
on the importance of the legal process as a social force and suggests that this can either
protect or empower people. The legal processes can however adversely impact upon
people's states of mind. This study reports on 25 qualitative interviews with involuntary
inpatients of a major teaching hospital. The interviews were analysed thematically using
a general inductive approach. The analysis focused on the patients' general experience
of being placed under an ITO and their understanding of the ITO process. Generally,
those who described the experience of an ITO in more positive terms, also experienced
the ITO as a positive right. In addition to providing them with the treatment needed, they
also felt that the ITO gave them protection and guidance. Conversely, those who
experienced being placed under an ITO in more negative or mixed ways, described
feeling powerless in the process, as they felt that the ITO took away their rights. By and
large the ITO process was experienced as arbitrary when patients did not understand
the reasons for their admission. In addition, these patients had limited or no information
about their involuntary treatment order and they did not know what was expected of
them to have the ITO revoked. Most importantly, they did not feel that there were any

Enforcer, manager or leader? The judicial role in family violence courts.

[Journal Article]

UI: 20884050

Judicial supervision of offenders is an important component of many family violence
courts. Skepticism concerning the ability of offenders to reform and a desire to protect
victims has led to some judges to use supervision as a form of deterrence. Supervision
is also used to hold offenders accountable for following court orders. Some family
violence courts apply processes used in drug courts, such as rewards and sanctions, to
promote offender rehabilitation. This article suggests that while protection and support of
victims should be the prime concern of family violence courts, a form of judging that
engages offenders in the development and implementation of solutions for their
problems and supports their implementation is more likely to promote their positive
behavioral change than other approaches to judicial supervision. The approach to
judging proposed in this article draws from therapeutic jurisprudence, feminist theory,
transformational leadership and solution-focused brief therapy principles.

Much about what used to be termed "disciplinary" investigations and hearings is being
revisited in the modern era. Therapeutic jurisprudence enables informed and sensitive
awareness to potentially therapeutic and counter-therapeutic effects of both
investigations and hearings conducted by medical regulatory authorities. This article
analyses key aspects of authorities' processes from the perspective of noti ers/
complainants and practitioners. Using developments at the Victorian Medical
Practitioners Board as a base, it addresses issues of both investigative procedures and
decision-making at formal and informal hearings, as well as the rami cations of re-
hearings for the integrity of peer review informed regulation. It argues that where
reclamation of practitioners is possible (namely where impropriety is not of the most
serious order), there is much that is constructive about a focus upon enhancement of
performance and competence levels, rather than the traditional preoccupation with
whether registered status needs to be affected as a result of practitioner conduct.

Therapeutic jurisprudence in the courts.

Casey P(1), Rottman DB.

Therapeutic jurisprudence is an emerging eld of law and social science inquiry
that explores the role of the law in fostering therapeutic or antitherapeutic
outcomes. This article considers the relationship between therapeutic
jurisprudence and court performance goals, examines applications of therapeutic
jurisprudence in court settings, discusses the steps involved in incorporating
therapeutic jurisprudence principles into the work of courts, outlines the pros
and cons associated with practicing therapeutic jurisprudence primarily in
specialized courts, and offers suggestions for fostering continued
experimentation by courts.

     Changes in the way people marry, bear children and live together, combined with
     the changing nature of support for families, has put pressure on the justice
     system to adjust to new family and community realities in order to accomplish
     justice goals. Although the entire legal system is implicated by the changing
     nature of families and communities, most scholars and practitioners have focused
     on the judicial system and those courts most relevant to family issues: namely,
     the juvenile, family, and criminal courts. As scholars and practitioners began
     to 'rethink justice,' whole new reform movements of therapeutic jurisprudence,
     restorative justice, and community justice (among others) have emerged to offer
     new paradigms for the administration of justice. In this essay we discuss ways
     in which families and the justice system interact to strengthen and weaken each
     other to accomplish justice goals.

     Therapeutic jurisprudence and con icts among values in mental health law.

     Schopp RF(1).

     Therapeutic Jurisprudence provides a conceptual framework for a research agenda
     designed to promote development of legal rules, procedures, and roles in a
     manner consistent with the therapeutic mission of the mental health system. As
     such, it draws attention to the tension between the jurisprudential values of
     autonomy and well-being that permeates mental health law speci cally and the
     law and ethics of health care generally. This article advances an analysis of
     these values in the context of the patient-centered approach to health care. The
     article endorses a priority for the deontic aspect of autonomy over well-being
     but allows balancing of the consequentialist component of autonomy against
     well-being. Finally, it applies this framework to several traditionally
     dif cult types of cases.

From therapeutic jurisprudence...to jurisprudent therapy.

Drogin EY(1).

For nearly a decade, "therapeutic jurisprudence" (TJ) has provided a theoretical
framework within which legal rules, legal procedure, and legal roles are
analyzed in terms of their therapeutic, neutral, or antitherapeutic effects.
This article proposed "jurisprudent therapy" (JT), an extension of the TJ model,
as a context for analyzing mental health science, mental health practice, and
mental health roles in terms of their "jurisprudent," neutral, or
"antijurisprudent" effects. The JT perspective neither supplants nor supersedes
TJ; rather, it mirrors and augments an established process for interdisciplinary
contrast, comparison, and integration. Just as an empathic and evolving legal
system provides psychological bene ts, so does a legally informed and
juridically compatible progression of social science promote principles of
justice and human freedom. Consideration of these two complementary models in
tandem yields an array of brainstorming devices, to synergistic effect, with
heuristic implications for teaching, research, and service delivery.

Outpatient commitment: a therapeutic jurisprudence analysis.

Winick BJ(1).

This article analyzes the legal and therapeutic jurisprudence considerations
raised by outpatient commitment. Although older forms of outpatient commitment
have both legal and therapeutic advantages, preventive outpatient commitment
raises serious legal problems and potential antitherapeutic consequences that
may outweigh its claimed therapeutic value. As a result, alternatives are
proposed, including wider availability of community treatment and outreach and
case management services, assertive community treatment, police and mental
health court diversion programs, and creative uses of advanced directive
instruments and behavioral contracting. Proposals also are made for how
preventive outpatient commitment can be applied more therapeutically, including
hearings that accord patients a sense of procedural justice and techniques
designed to motivate individuals facing such hearings to agree to accept
treatment voluntarily.

The return of drugs courts: Some important considerations.

Ward DJ(1), Kawalek DA(2).


Drugs courts can be praised for the rehabilitative health-treatment response
they deliver to people with drugs dependence problems. This is when contrasted
with traditional courts that operate on adversarial and retributive justice
principles and do little to alleviate cycles of repeat drugs offending. Whilst
drugs courts have been met with success and embraced in several jurisdictions
worldwide, fundamental points need to be raised on the model that is re-emerging
in England and Wales. Indications are it will involve drugs testing and a
'graduated sanctions and incentives system' that comprises short custodial
sentences for non-compliance. This essay discusses the newly emerging drugs
court model as signposted within different legislative and public policy
documents and raises questions relating to the precise model these courts will
take; whether they prioritise harm reduction or if 'abstinence' goals will
predominate. We question whether people with drugs dependence problems should be
sanctioned to short custodial prison sentences if in breach of a drugs court
order. And perhaps more fundamentally: do we need drugs courts in the English
and Welsh justice system?

               Therapeutic jurisprudence and the resolution of value con icts: what we can
               realistically expect, in practice, from theory.

               Kress K(1).

               This article assesses the criticisms of therapeutic jurisprudence that it cannot
               resolve value con icts, especially between autonomy rights and therapeutic
               values, or, less radically, that it has not provided a general method for
               resolving con icts. Grounded in general jurisprudential principles about
               con ict resolution, including novel developments respecting the meaning of
               weighing and balancing, the article rejects the criticisms as unfounded. The
               article also develops and critiques arguments maintaining that therapeutic
               jurisprudence cannot resolve certain value con icts because the values are
               incommensurable. The argument is illustrated by examples concerning the right to
               refuse treatment, and jurisprudential analyses of that right.

               Examining the links between therapeutic jurisprudence and mental health court
               completion.

               Redlich AD(1), Han W(2).

               Research demonstrates that mental health courts (MHCs) lead to improved outcomes
               compared to traditional criminal court processes. An underlying premise of MHCs
               is therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ). However, no research, to our knowledge, has
               examined whether MHC outcomes are predicted by TJ principles as theorized. In
               the present study, we examined whether principles measured at the onset of MHC
               enrollment (knowledge, perceived voluntariness, and procedural justice)
               predicted MHC completion (graduation). Using structural equation modeling with
               MHC participants from four courts, a signi cant, direct relationship between TJ
               and MHC completion was found, such that higher levels of TJ were associated with
               higher rates of success. Although this direct effect became nonsigni cant when
               mediator variables were included, a signi cant indirect path remained, such
               that increased levels of initial perceived voluntariness and procedural justice,

Therapeutic jurisprudence: A framework for evidence-informed health care
policymaking.

Campbell AT(1).

Translation of evidence-based practice (EBP) into health care policy is of
growing importance, with discussions most often focused on how to fund and
otherwise promote EBP through policy (i.e., at system level, beyond the
bedside). Less attention has been focused on how to ensure that such policies -
as enacted and implemented, and as distinguished from the practices underlying
policies - do not themselves cause harm, or at least frustrate accomplishment of
"therapeutic" goals of EBP. On a different front, principles of therapeutic
jurisprudence (TJ) in law have been developed, most prominently in certain areas
of law (e.g., mental health and family law), to support more collaborative, less
traumatic advocacy and con ict resolution. This paper draws on current
applications of TJ and translates such into a therapeutic approach to health
care policymaking that moves beyond promotion of EBP in policy. Health care
policy itself may be viewed as an intervention that impacts health, positively
or not. The goal is to offer a framework for health care policymaking grounded
in TJ principles that does not focus on which evidence is "right" for policy
use, but rather how we can better understand how consequences of policy,
intended or not, affect the well-being of populations. Such framework thus moves
policymaking from an either/or debate to a data- and human-driven process.
Utilizing TJ framing questions, policies can be developed and evaluated through
open dialogue among diverse voices at the table, including - like interventions



                                                                                Page 28
         fl
- the "patients" or, here, targets of such policies. Collectively, they clarify
how ends sought - to enhance (or at least not impair) health - can best be
achieved through policy when needed, recognizing that as an intervention, there
are limits to and boundaries on the usefulness of policy.

Therapeutic jurisprudence and end-of-life medical care: physician perceptions of
a statute's impact.

Kapp MB(1).

OBJECTIVE: Assess the perceptions of Ohio physicians regarding the impact of
their state's 1990 advance directive legislation on their medical practices when
decisions need to be made and implemented concerning use of life-prolonging
medical interventions, and to draw public policy.
DESIGN: A mailed survey to physicians, to be completed and returned anonymously.
The form contained ten questions to be answered according to a ve-point Likert
scale, a request for demographic information, and an opportunity to write
additional comments on the form.
SETTING: Surveys mailed to every physician on the Wright State University
continuing medical education mailing list who had designated a specialty in
internal medicine, family practice, or surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' perceptions of the impact of Ohio's advance
directive legislation on their communication with patients and families,
anxieties about legal liability associated with end-of-life care, and
willingness to limit life-prolonging medical interventions in speci c
situations.
RESULTS: Mixed. While many physicians reported enhancements in relationships,
communication, and willingness to respect patient and family wishes due to the
statute, others reported an opposite effect. For many physicians, the statute
made little impact on their practices.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ohio statute could bene t from rewriting, but there are
inherent problems with advance directive laws. Professional education about
death and dying issues and the chance for physicians to practice end-of-life
treatment techniques are essential.

The past, present and future of mental health law: a therapeutic jurisprudence
analysis.

Allan A.

This article uses a therapeutic jurisprudence perspective to review the
evolution of mental health law in the Western world by examining developments at
various stages in history, in particular the 20th century. It suggests that one
of the major challenges for the future, from a therapeutic jurisprudence
perspective, will be to help minimise the stigma, prejudice and discrimination
associated with mental health law. The article concludes with the suggestion
that the question of whether mental health law itself, because it contributes to
discrimination against mentally disordered people, may be anti-therapeutic
requires more investigation and consideration.

The POLST paradigm for patients with advanced, irreversible illness: a therapeutic
jurisprudence basis for legal codi cation.

Kapp MB(1).

The Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm attempts to
improve the experiences of individuals with serious, irreversible illness, and
their families. In some jurisdictions, the POLST is authorized in law. In other
jurisdictions, efforts are underway or contemplated to encourage use of POLST
for appropriate individuals, but the concept is not yet in law. An argument
needs to be made to policymakers that POLST will have a therapeutic effect on
patients and families. In making that argument, the analytical lens of
therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) may be useful. This article proposes a POLST
legal strategy using TJ. TJ may be used to evaluate data regarding psychological
effects on patients and families who are experiencing medical care with or
without POLST; the TJ analysis then should be considered by policymakers in
enacting POLST laws to codify clinical consensus, and in turn the law so enacted
would exert a positive impact on therapeutic bene t-producing behavior by
health care providers.

          Seclusion and restraint in 1985: a review and update.

          Soloff PH, Gutheil TG, Wexler DB.

          The 1982 Supreme Court decision in Youngberg v. Romeo gave mental health
          professionals exibility to exercise professional judgment in using seclusion
          to control violent patients, and also suggested that seclusion and restraint
          might be used when patients exhibit disruptive behavior that may lead to
          violence. The authors reviewed 13 studies of seclusion and restraint in adult
          inpatient psychiatric settings to de ne indications for use. They found that
          seclusion and restraint practices varied widely depending on the population
          served and the philosophical orientation of the hospital staff, and were more
          often used to contain behavior that might lead to violence rather than to
          control violent behavior itself. They conclude that there is overwhelming
          empirical support for using seclusion and restraint to limit the progression of
          disruptive behavior to actual violence, but that the decision to do so should be
          based on sound clinical judgment.
